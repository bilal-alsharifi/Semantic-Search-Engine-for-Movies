1
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:18,879
There is a place

2
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:23,756
That is so hard to find

3
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,140
Behind the walls

4
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,728
We build inside our minds

5
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:41,232
Some break the walls
some break the rules

6
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:46,822
Some even get things changed

7
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:52,327
And when they do
that leads to the truth

8
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:56,325
Yet questions still remain

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,250
But all that it's saying

10
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,838
Somewhere in life
there's a joy to be

11
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:10,557
Between the hope and reality

12
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:14,433
There in a mirror
and then the street

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,773
That's where you'll find

14
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:23,977
People in search of a life

15
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:37,036
And what of love

16
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:42,078
Is that a point of view

17
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:47,879
And when you're alone

18
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:53,266
It can seem so confused

19
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:59,519
That's when a friend
can pull you in

20
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:04,805
Lend you a helping hand

21
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:10,197
But what happens when
your only friend

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,736
Sells you out in the end

23
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:17,359
How do you face it

24
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:22,787
Somewhere in life
there's a joy to be

25
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:28,588
Between the hope and reality

26
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,463
There in a mirror
and then the street

27
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,006
That's where you'll find

28
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:41,054
People in search of a life

29
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:44,601
In search of a life

30
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,112
Searchin'

31
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,494
Lookin' in a bottle

32
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,076
Lookin' in a needle

33
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:17,960
Lookin' in the street,
yeah, yeah, yeah

34
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:24,891
Searchin'

35
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,141
Everywhere

36
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,581
Straight from Brooklyn
better known as Crooklyn

37
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,457
Never take us short
cos Brooklyn's the borough

38
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,713
Straight from Brooklyn
better known as Crooklyn

39
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,463
Never take us short
cos Brooklyn's the borough

40
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,919
We did it like that
and now we do it like this

41
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,713
We did it like that
and now we do it like this

42
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:13,059
Yeah.

43
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:16,353
Now the clock hits
who got the cocaine

44
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:19,103
Don't tell me it's
the little kids on Soul Train

45
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,357
The metaphor sent
from my brain to my jaw

46
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,858
It comes from other places
not the typical places

47
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:26,277
Journalistic values are yellow
and then the court falters

48
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:29,278
You watch Channel Zero
and that bitch Barbara Walters

49
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,616
She'll have you believe
black invented crack

50
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:35,245
When President Lyndon had to form
a law way back in '63 with Kennedy

51
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,619
Yes, the double-cross

52
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,419
Remember that's when they blew
his fucking head off

53
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,996
Vietnam vets come back lookin'
like one-armed pets

54
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:45,005
Mixin' thoughts, purer text

55
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,623
No picket fence,
no job, no ATM in the car

56
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:49,586
Blue collar comes to bourgeois

57
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,677
Depressed in your chest...

58
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:54,260
- Chuck D is the bomb, boy.
- What?

59
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:57,226
Get the fuck outta here.
Chuck D ain't shit.

60
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:01,018
That nigger Chuck D is assed out,
and the rest of Public Enemy.

61
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,520
Speech, motherfucker. What about him?

62
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,275
Speech? He a bitch-ass nigger.

63
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,687
How the fuck this thing gonna say
Chuck D the hardest rapper?

64
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:12,522
- Nigger ain't never shot nobody.
- You gotta be hard nowadays!

65
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,362
First, I know niggers
ain't slappin' bitches up.

66
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:17,238
They ain't takin' pussy.

67
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:20,455
Niggers ain't shootin' up,
ain't done time for murder.

68
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:21,993
How the fuck they hard?

69
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:25,625
Do what you gonna do. I ain't buyin'
shit that ain't hard-core.

70
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:28,672
You ain't gotta shoot nobody
to prove you're hard-core.

71
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,624
- What kinda shit is that?
- Hold on.

72
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:34,720
Only niggers I have representin'
is my man Tupac, G-Rap and Wu-Tang.

73
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:38,511
- Motherfuckin' Dr Dre, straight up.
- You said it. No fuckin' around.

74
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,883
Niggers talkin'
all this positive shit.

75
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:43,342
Motherfuckin' world ain't positive.

76
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:47,345
That's why motherfuckin'
sex and violence sell more records.

77
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,475
I like positive rappers, get it?

78
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:54,947
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Them niggers ain't homeboys.

79
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,240
Put them poor-ass niggers over there.

80
00:05:58,284 --> 00:05:59,826
Come on, come on, yo, yo.

81
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:03,036
Forget that shit, man.
We gots to be about business.

82
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,322
And, Go, you ain't
supposed to be over here.

83
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:08,909
Get your ass over there!
You supposed to be on the lookout.

84
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,546
- This ain't no joke.
- It's hot outside, man.

85
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,916
We gots to get that money.

86
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:19,459
I understand that, too,
but it's hot, man.

87
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,522
Psst!

88
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,526
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man? How ya doin'?

89
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,363
- It's cool.
- What you need?

90
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,361
- What you got today?
- I got red caps. They're phat.

91
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,698
- Two for one, man.
- Lemme take two.

92
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:48,865
Two? All right, brother.
Just hang tight, all right?

93
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:56,035
- Everything all right, man?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:02,250
Shit, you know that, man.

95
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:09,467
Children of the ghetto

96
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,477
Runnin' wild and free

97
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:25,151
In a country's jungle

98
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:33,329
Filled with misery

99
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:39,710
There's no inspiration...

100
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:44,210
What's up, man?
You got the money?

101
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:47,294
To brighten up their day...

102
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,751
Keep an eye out, all right?

103
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:53,136
Raise up!

104
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,979
Motherfucker! Come here!

105
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,098
Get off me, man! Get off me!

106
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,436
Strike, where's the fuckin' dope?
Stand the fuck up.

107
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,412
Where the vials at, man?
I know you're carrying.

108
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,747
Collars for dollars. What the fuck
is this? The local church?

109
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,950
Yes, yes. Ah, gotcha.

110
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,753
- What you doin'?
- Don't be touchin' me, man.

111
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,705
I got nothin', man!

112
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:30,923
Get off my ass! I don't be playin'
that maricone shit.

113
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,968
- I love the smell of surprise...
- Smell your fuckin' breath.

114
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:37,048
It smells
like victory, brother!

115
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:45,355
Always in the news

116
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:52,186
Toughness is their motto

117
00:08:56,324 --> 00:09:01,033
And bitter are their blues...

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,409
Open your fuckin' mouth.
Lift up your fuckin' tongue.

119
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:08,831
Lemme see under your tongue. Open.

120
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,372
Take off your fuckin' pants,
or whatever you call 'em.

121
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:15,215
Dicky check time.

122
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,425
Spread your butt cheeks, man.
Spread 'em. Let's go.

123
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,130
Let's see under your balls.

124
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,671
You know I hate doin' this.

125
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:26,385
Lemme see under your ball bag.

126
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,520
Strike's balls.
Strikes and balls. Yo!

127
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:33,478
Three-two, full count.
Bases loaded. With bacon strips.

128
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:37,475
- Pull up your pants, bitch.
- Man, where's your personal hygiene?

129
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,396
You're a motherfuckin' liar. I change
my drawers every day. I stays clean!

130
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,691
Let's get the fuck outta here.
It's over!

131
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:46,412
- See you later, bro.
- Fuck you, too, man.

132
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:48,660
Fuck whoever you beeper...
Guys!

133
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,414
Some niggers had you assed out.

134
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,158
Glad to be of service!

135
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,998
Somebody gonna drop
a cylinder block on your ass!

136
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,004
Take that gun and badge!

137
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,169
Ain't got the stomach
for this shit no more.

138
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:10,174
You see my doctor yet?

139
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,346
You go see my doctor
like I told you?

140
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:21,106
That Moo shit is what's killin' you.
Get rid of that shit.

141
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,606
Here. Drink that.

142
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,943
Not the whole thing.

143
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:45,502
Yo, Rodney.
Can't take it much longer, man.

144
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,627
I'm tellin' you.

145
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:54,091
Maybe you won't have to
take it much longer.

146
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:24,751
You know who that is?
That's Darryl.

147
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:28,959
That's Darryl Adams, the thief.
That's who that is.

148
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:30,965
He's stealin' from me.

149
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,710
Layin' back in the cut, passin'
some baggies and rakin' in the dough.

150
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:39,425
Nice indoors work, huh, Darryl?.
Clean, safe.

151
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:42,180
You got this clown
in there sellin' ounces?

152
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,936
Why him? What's up with me?

153
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,553
Cos you like my son, man.

154
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,560
Strike, my son.

155
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,895
If I'm so much your son, why my black
ass always on them benches?

156
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,900
I need you to be
where I need you to be.

157
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,191
Had this dream last night.

158
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,823
I'm standin' in the desert
with all my kids.

159
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,623
My for-real kids,
my kids from the store.

160
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,123
They's all laid out in front
of me like they's my army.

161
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:13,001
God comes up, points at you.

162
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,840
Tells me, "This one right here is
gonna be your sword and your staff. "

163
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,715
God, man. God said that.

164
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:25,054
He pointed right at you.

165
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:29,180
Darryl Adams wasn't even in
the motherfuckin' dream,

166
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,147
cos that boy's a thief,
and he got to be got.

167
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,729
- "Got"?
- Got.

168
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:39,649
Can't you get Errol
for that shit, man?

169
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:42,865
You know Errol
gave hisself the Big "A".

170
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:45,151
The virus.

171
00:12:46,204 --> 00:12:49,074
My man messed around
and took that "A" train.

172
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,741
Anyway, can you see Errol in there,

173
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:57,336
sellin' whale on a bun
and ounces and fries?

174
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,965
Nah.

175
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,963
Strike, you really want
to get off the benches?

176
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,136
You deal with it...

177
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,260
for me.

178
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,008
The illa killa
the one for the thriller

179
00:13:58,062 --> 00:14:00,221
The one from the hood
actin' like a gorilla

180
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,977
I need the illa killa
the one for the thriller

181
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,481
The one from the hood
actin' like a gorilla...

182
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,022
You got any chocolate Moos?

183
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:09,359
No, we don't got
no damn chocolate Moos.

184
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:12,075
- This is a bar, son.
- Mooooo.

185
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,869
- Yo, Ronnie!
- Oh, shit.

186
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:24,917
- What's up, man?
- What you doin' here, man?

187
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,204
You know, just slidin' through.

188
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:31,548
Yo, big bro.
I was just thinkin' about you, man.

189
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:33,800
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

190
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,171
Yeah, well, I love you, too, Ronnie.

191
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,678
All right. Good. Good.

192
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:41,394
The chick is in a hole cos she
shouldn't have freakin' shot...

193
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,103
Here. Try this. It's sweet.

194
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:58,033
- You know that's Ahab's over there.
- What?

195
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:02,121
- You know that's Ahab's over there.
- Yeah, the competition.

196
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:06,908
You know that clown that works
in there? The night manager, Darryl?.

197
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,711
- Darryl?. No.
- Darryl Adams.

198
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:13,080
Yo, the brother is bad peoples.

199
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:17,584
Now, how is, uh...
How is Darryl Adams bad people?

200
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:22,464
Cos, yo, he beat up
this honey Charise, man.

201
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:26,465
She's only 16, kid.
She came in askin' for a job.

202
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,093
This nigger took her
to the back office,

203
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:31,139
talkin' 'bout "slob my johnson".

204
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,104
And when she said no, he started
slappin' her up and shit.

205
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:37,192
Yo, the brother's foul.

206
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:40,073
- A woman beater.
- Yup.

207
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:42,820
A dope-dealin' woman beater.

208
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,825
Man, I don't know about all that.

209
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,120
- Who's sayin' all this?
- Yo, man, the shit is real.

210
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,951
Her moms is mad stressed out
about that shit.

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,574
She wants some
motherfuckin' payback, yo.

212
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:55,834
She wants to see that man dead.

213
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,008
What if it was you, your daughter?
Charise is her only child.

214
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,048
He just got to be got, huh?

215
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,887
Well?.

216
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,549
Yo, got ya, comin' at ya
chrome to the dome...

217
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,518
- Wasn't that your favourite song?
- Come on, man.

218
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,720
Vic, why you fuckin' with me, man?

219
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:17,097
I'm tryin' to kick
some serious shit here.

220
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,396
Should've known I couldn't
come to see you about nothin'.

221
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:25,571
I know somebody.

222
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:26,991
Who?

223
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,322
- My Man.
- Well, who that?

224
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,572
Look, My Man. A friend of a friend.

225
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,456
He'll do the job.

226
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,785
- How much he talkin' about?
- Nothin'.

227
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,793
So what's the deal?.

228
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,627
I'm listenin'.
What you want me to do?

229
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:48,126
Nothin', man. All right?
Just chill. All right?

230
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,179
So my little mans,
my nephews, how they doin'?

231
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,475
I miss my kids, man.

232
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,976
Why don't you just
take your ass home then?

233
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:18,538
There's the motherfucker.
What's up, Strike?

234
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:21,327
Yo, black, we closed.

235
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,045
Besides, I thought
you don't eat this shit

236
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,412
because it fucks with your stomach.

237
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:28,041
This is Ahab's, nigger.

238
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,752
We ain't got no Di-Gel,
no Kaopectate, no pussy-Bismol!

239
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,807
Boom! Gotcha!

240
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,346
Boom. Gotcha.

241
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,647
You still here, motherfucker?
What's up?

242
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,939
Mylanta! We need more Mylanta
out here for this girl!

243
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,565
Boom!

244
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,949
Probably a fuckin' triple-header.

245
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,235
Outdoors in the mud,
60 casings around,

246
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,580
and a big herd of Nubians
stepping all over everything, man.

247
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:10,998
- Alla salute.
- Mazel tov.

248
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:17,300
Ahh! I just don't like
them aeroplane bottles.

249
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:49,405
What the fuck happened?

250
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:52,328
- Oh, that boy got shot up!
- Who did?

251
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:59,872
I wouldn't know. I wasn't here, so
I can't talk intelligently about it.

252
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:04,053
Yo, uh... I wouldn't want you
not to talk intelligently.

253
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,465
The body cold already.

254
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:11,304
Excuse me. Coming through. Thank you.

255
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:13,641
Damn! Excuse me

256
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:18,108
Hey! Welcome to the show
that never ends.

257
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:20,108
Bartucci, what you got?

258
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:23,402
We got a black male, dead man.
Darryl Adams, 22 years old.

259
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,689
He's the night manager of this joint.

260
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:29,406
Kid's standin' by the door having
a conversation with another male.

261
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,026
Pop, pop, poppity-pop.
Darryl goes down.

262
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,954
Shooter does a Carl Lewis.

263
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,999
Neighbourhood says
there's four shots fired.

264
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,201
At this point, that's all she wrote.

265
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:41,791
- Robbery?
- Nah. Way too fast.

266
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,915
Drugs? Was he a scumbag?

267
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:47,086
To tell you the truth,
I never seen this kid before.

268
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:53,219
Boys, Darryl Adams.
Darryl Adams, the boys.

269
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:56,267
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hello in there.

270
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,392
Live by the gun,
die by the gun.

271
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:05,267
- The kid had brains.
- Good thing he was wearin' his gold.

272
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,312
Bing, bing, bing. Ricochet Rabbit.

273
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:09,439
I still think it was the food here.

274
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,981
Hal, get in there,
tell me what you got.

275
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:16,534
There she blows.

276
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,071
Let's see.
No powder burns on the face.

277
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:23,750
- These eyes have lied.
- Looking about 30, 35 years old.

278
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:26,120
- Doors one and two.
- OK, let's see.

279
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,547
Nothin' up the sleeve.

280
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,163
He might get better,
but he ain't never gettin' well.

281
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:32,210
- And presto!
- Hey, slapped him five.

282
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:34,254
On the light hand side.

283
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:38,088
Hey, look at that. Looks like some
kind of an Egyptian peace sign.

284
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:41,178
You're right there. It says goodbye.

285
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:44,264
Hey, Moe. My main man.
Gonna need prints off that door.

286
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:47,101
Fuck you, Rocco.
That'll really narrow it down

287
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,688
We'll get half the yos
in Brooklyn off this door.

288
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:52,273
- What, did you eat at Ahab's Burger?
- Yeah.

289
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:54,563
- You owe me six more.
- I love my job, too.

290
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,157
More prints than my ex-wife.

291
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,951
- He wearing any?
- Be with you in a second.

292
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:01,781
Must be his golf jacket.
It's got 18 holes.

293
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,246
Oh, Christ!

294
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:06,870
What the fuck did he eat?

295
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:09,076
Come out, come out,
wherever you are

296
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,417
The monkey's on the trolley car

297
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:14,915
Looks like they did come out.
Here's one. Two. Two exits.

298
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,592
What's the grapevine say?

299
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:20,051
What they always say.
"We keep our ear to the grindstone. "

300
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,505
- Was he clockin'?
- I don't know.

301
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:24,680
- Hal, how ya doin'?
- How ya doin', Lar.

302
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:26,719
- Check the pockets.
- Yeah.

303
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,391
Son of a bitch! That's Darryl Adams!

304
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,602
Who?

305
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:33,318
He worked in Rodney's candy store.
I saw him a lot.

306
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,767
If he worked for Rodney,
he was clockin'.

307
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,986
- Hal, check the pockets again.
- Sure. Hold on.

308
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,238
- Nothin'.
- What's up, Darryl?.

309
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:46,611
Clockin' like a motherfucker, man.

310
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,744
You guys done yet?

311
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,542
Ho! Marvello the magician!

312
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:54,621
- Catch a bullet with his teeth.
- What a catch!

313
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:57,956
- What a smile.
- Darryl, you've outdone Willie Mays.

314
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,632
You got my vote for MVP.

315
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:02,462
Another stain on the sidewalk, huh?

316
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,099
Get a pail and a mop.
Get it over with.

317
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:08,303
One, two, three.

318
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,978
Arrivederci!

319
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:17,101
All right. Show's over!
Officers, send 'em home!

320
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,941
- See ya, Hal.
- Take care.

321
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:22,520
Yo, Moe, don't make me have to come
back for those fuckin' prints!

322
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:25,109
- What you cursin' about?
- I'm sorry.

323
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:30,159
Beep beep.

324
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:33,655
Excuse me.

325
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:35,865
All right. I won't do it gain.

326
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,993
I'm outta here, man.

327
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:49,635
- Got 50 bucks?
- Nah, man.

328
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:52,469
Well, all I find, all I keep.

329
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:58,682
Don't be lookin' at me
in the eye, nigger.

330
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,146
Your ass will be on this mural, too.
I know that look.

331
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:06,818
See, you wonderin' how
I got that AIDS, ain't ya?

332
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:10,445
- Nah, man.
- You a lyin' motherfucker!

333
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:13,326
It wasn't from fuckin'
with them punks.

334
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,610
I ain't no homosexual.

335
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:18,580
No, man, I ain't say
all that, all right?

336
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:21,079
Fuckin' with this shit.

337
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,746
I can't believe I got this shit.

338
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,127
All this time
in these motherfuckin' streets!

339
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:34,178
And I'm a smart motherfucker.

340
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:38,223
I know I should've
left that shit alone.

341
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,435
One time I was studyin'
to be an accountant.

342
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:48,892
Now this shit is fuckin' my body up.
I have a goddam death sentence.

343
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:54,109
That's why I don't
give a shit about nobody.

344
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:56,861
And I don't wanna
see your ass no more!

345
00:23:57,701 --> 00:24:01,829
Cos you ain't got no business
out here fuckin' with this shit.

346
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:05,205
You'll end up like me. Or worse.

347
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,537
My old man...

348
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:10,875
was a preacher.

349
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:17,298
And when I started messin'
with this shit,

350
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:21,588
he said, "You gonna pay for that.

351
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,429
"You gonna pay for that shit, boy. "

352
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,440
He was right.

353
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:36,559
You can't cheat this shit no... mo'.

354
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:38,688
Get the fuck outta here!

355
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:45,035
Why you wanna be
always arguin' with me?

356
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:48,198
No, wait. Listen to me.
How many pair sneakers you got?

357
00:24:48,248 --> 00:24:50,620
- The pair I got on makes six.
- Yo, Rodney.

358
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:54,001
- Wait a second. Six, right?
- Yeah.

359
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:57,663
- How many pair o' feet you got?
- Two, like everybody else.

360
00:24:57,715 --> 00:25:00,337
He don't see what I'm talkin' about.

361
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:02,543
- You don't, do you?
- What, man?

362
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:06,462
How you gonna make ten and spend ten,
nigger? Ten minus ten make what?

363
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,721
- Zero.
- You wanna be a zero nigger?

364
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,341
- I don't want me no zero nigger.
- You ain't got one.

365
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:14,064
Right. Now you see
what I'm sayin' to you?

366
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,596
Nigger wanna spend
all his money like that

367
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,057
gonna wake up broke
every day of his life.

368
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,609
Why? Cos the nigger
don't believe in hisself.

369
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:25,989
Thinkin' like a two-minute clock
instead of the long haul.

370
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,741
Long term. See your future.

371
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:31,070
Y'all come work for me,
this shit gonna be very different.

372
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:32,829
You gonna be savin' crazy money.

373
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:36,657
You gonna buy your moms
a house in Strong Island. Right?

374
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,923
Everybody stick out your hands
like this, palm down.

375
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:50,216
- What you all see?
- Black.

376
00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:53,099
- What you see?
- You 'posed to be seein' green.

377
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:55,265
All right. You get it, man?

378
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,517
No. You get it, nigger? You get it?

379
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:58,843
- I got it.
- All right.

380
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:04,104
Excuse me. Excuse me.

381
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:07,022
- You all have a job to do inside?
- Yeah.

382
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:10,606
Well, let's go. Who trash?

383
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:20,123
What's the matter with you?

384
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,788
Man, you ain't heard what happened?

385
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,291
I ain't heard nothin'.

386
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:28,588
You told me if I wanted
to get off them benches...

387
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:34,054
All's I hear is that Ahab's
lookin' for a new night manager.

388
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:35,674
I heard that.

389
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:41,967
Look here. You gonna chill
for a week or two, right?

390
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,888
Let the shit die down.
Be workin' still at my spot.

391
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:49,523
You gonna be on the benches,
but Ahab is the joint.

392
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:53,068
I'm tellin' you.
I got it. I'm all right.

393
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,025
Nigger look bad, boy.

394
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,199
What we're gonna do, we're gonna mix
the shit up with the food traffic.

395
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:06,708
Right? See, right now, we're doin'
way too much business from my spot.

396
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,791
We got a crowd of black,
white customers,

397
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,542
out-of-state license plates,
what have you.

398
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,584
Somebody gonna check that out. They
gonna drop a dime on me, call 911.

399
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,423
With my jacket,
I can't go back to jail.

400
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,923
Ahab gonna be a nice front.
You did good, Strike.

401
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,434
You did good.

402
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,889
Now why you lookin' like that?
Somethin' wrong?

403
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,938
You know it's me and you, right?

404
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,272
What I tell you?
You like my son, right?

405
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,573
I'm gonna look out for you. Right?

406
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:45,370
- I ain't let you down yet, have I?
- Nah.

407
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,037
OK, then.

408
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:50,284
Come in here. I'm gonna get
somethin' to eat for you.

409
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,207
Come on.

410
00:27:57,132 --> 00:27:58,460
Strike. What's up with
that train set you got?

411
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:01,177
- It's all right.
- Fuckin' Choo-Choo Charlie.

412
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:04,089
You readin' a train book? Choo-choo!

413
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:07,756
Every man should have a hobby.
What's yours? Collectin' welfare?

414
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:12,055
That shit ain't funny, man. Word up.
Why you tryin' to play me, Strike?

415
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:14,393
I don't talk about them...
Fuck that, man!

416
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,226
I don't talk about them toys
inside your crib.

417
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:20,110
Yeah, I know, cos I'll
bust your motherfuckin' ass.

418
00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:24,866
Yo, Shorty, what you laughin' at?

419
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:31,492
- One time says freeze!
- Fuck!

420
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,663
Hey, little man. Stay right there.

421
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,293
Stand up, mastermind.

422
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,709
Hmm. Oh. Is that Rodney?

423
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:50,087
- Rodney rang?
- You oughtta know.

424
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:54,265
- Y'all hear that noise about Darryl?.
- Yeah, man.

425
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,678
Yeah, well, I had to tell
his moms and pops last night.

426
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,220
That ain't no joke. I hate it.

427
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:01,816
Rough.

428
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:05,227
I just hope I never have to notify
none of your parents.

429
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,354
Leave this shit alone!

430
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,033
How them trains comin'?

431
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,327
Little man, come here. Come here.

432
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:25,122
What'd I tell you about bein' around
these knuckleheads? Huh?

433
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:29,667
Now, I'm watchin' you.
Go on upstairs.

434
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:33,632
Yo, Andre. Why don't you go chase
some criminals or somethin'?

435
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,099
Yo, Shorty. What you lookin' at?

436
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:52,651
Yo, come here, man.
Yeah, you. Come here.

437
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:55,698
Come on. Hurry up.
Quick. Time is money.

438
00:29:57,535 --> 00:29:59,409
Come here.

439
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:03,908
God damn, Shorty!
This is some nappy shit.

440
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:06,793
When the last time you been
in a barber shop?

441
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:08,033
I don't know.

442
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,042
'Put your hands up. '

443
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:18,711
Ding-ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding!

444
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:20,554
Watch out. Flip. Shoot.

445
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:24,422
Yo.

446
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:28,604
Watch out! Duck! Now what? Come on.

447
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:29,810
Yo!

00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:32,264
- Where you manners at?
- Thanks.

449
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:34,808
- What's your name, Shorty?
- Tyrone Jeeter.

450
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:37,269
All right. Shorty.

451
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:41,946
Yo, there goes
my brother, Victor. Shit.

452
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:43,950
- Wait here, all right?
- All right.

453
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,071
Be right back.

454
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,704
Vic!

455
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,730
Uh! Watch out! Oh, man!

456
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,270
Uh! Uh! Flip!

457
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:43,714
- Who did this? Huh? Who did this?
- ¿Qué?

458
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:47,258
Who did this? Who did this?
Who did this?

459
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:49,973
Who did this? Who did this?

460
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:53,679
Who's tryin' to be my son's daddy
and gave him this haircut?

461
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:01,389
Nobody don't know
nothin' now, huh?

462
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,932
Yo no sé nada.

463
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:07,769
I know you. I know you.

464
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:10,574
Cedric Stanley Gilmore.

465
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:16,161
And I know you, too. Ronnie Dunham.

466
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:17,699
Shit.

467
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:20,417
You used to live
next door to me, remember?

468
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:25,121
I know your mother. Gloria.

469
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:31,589
You all ain't nothin' but a bunch of
good-for-nothin', death-dealin' scum.

470
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:34,637
I find out who's been
messin' with Tyrone,

471
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:39,259
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your butt my own damn self.

472
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,097
Don't let me find Andre either.

473
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:46,806
Have a good Sunday.

474
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:55,530
Shit. I know that bitch
ain't talkin' to me.

475
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:57,567
- Scientific, man, shut up.
- You shut up, man.

476
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:07,624
OK, Victor? Ready to go?

477
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:14,791
Normally I'd cuff you, brother,

478
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:17,547
but you look like
the kind of guy I can trust.

479
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:24,676
Like I said.
I had some drinks at Kool Breeze.

480
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:27,479
- Uh, Scotch.
- "Some"?

481
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:29,893
Like two or three.

482
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,190
I usually go in there
after most work nights.

483
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:36,319
Uh-huh. How long were you in there?

484
00:33:36,363 --> 00:33:40,277
Uh, I don't know.
About eight-thirty till about ten.

485
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:43,610
Uh, see... My shift... at Hambones -

486
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:46,069
I'm a... I'm a manager.

487
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:48,996
It don't end till ten.

488
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,995
I wasn't feelin' very good,
so I left early.

489
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,706
You weren't feelin' good,
so you went to Kool Breeze?

490
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:02,667
It wasn't like it was a "goin' home"
not feelin' good.

491
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:05,342
You had a headache? An argument?

492
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:12,141
No, I just... just tired, man.

493
00:34:13,689 --> 00:34:15,183
Go ahead.

494
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:19,277
So I left Kool Breeze,
uh, started walkin' home.

495
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:21,893
I cut through Ahab's parking lot.

496
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:25,565
And this guy just flexed on me, man.
He jumped outta nowhere.

497
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:28,452
I got scared. You know the rest.

498
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:30,570
Tell me, Victor.

499
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,657
I just... I shot him.

500
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:38,873
Hey, little man.
I like that cut.

501
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:41,625
- Where'd you get it?
- Barber shop.

502
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:53,011
You know, you used to have
a good head on your shoulders

503
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:55,098
before Rodney got a hold of you.

504
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,469
Still do.

505
00:34:57,521 --> 00:35:02,598
You know, Ronald, I been lookin' out
for you since you been yea high.

506
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:06,601
Now, you don't want my guidance?
Fine. It's your life.

507
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:08,731
Let me tell you somethin'.

508
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:12,530
You even glance in the direction
of that little kid Tyrone,

509
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,325
and I'm gonna fuck you up so bad
you're gonna wish I had killed you.

510
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:19,207
Now, do we have an understanding?

511
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,204
Do we have an understanding?

512
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,922
Yeah.

513
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:27,964
Why do we keep goin' through this?
I told you already.

514
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:32,919
The guy jumped outta nowhere, I
got scared... Bam! Then I ran. I ran!

515
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:34,762
You mean bam, bam, bam, bam.

516
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:37,890
- What?
- Four bullets in the body.

517
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:42,185
- Where did you carry the gun?
- In my gym bag.

518
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:44,974
What else you carry in it?

519
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:50,482
My uniform from Hambones,
a sandwich from home.

520
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:53,233
I don't eat Hambones myself,
as quiet as it's kept.

521
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:57,493
OK. Was the, uh,
gym bag zippered, locked?

522
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,363
Don't shake your head, Victor.

523
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:03,869
- Where's my mattresses?
- What?

524
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,585
I told you about my mattresses
for them kids.

525
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:11,087
They ask, "You say we gonna have
a tumblin' club. We need mattresses. "

526
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:15,378
And I say, "Well, Strike's
buyin' 'em. He promised. "

527
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:17,752
Now, look, I ain't busted you yet,

528
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:21,802
but till I do,
you gonna be my main benefactor.

529
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,850
You gonna sponsor this club,
you understand me?

530
00:36:24,894 --> 00:36:28,891
And, Ronald, I'm only tellin'
you one more time, you hear?

531
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:32,899
The store was closed.
One of them Jewish holidays.

532
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:36,359
- What Jewish holiday?
- I don't know. Pick one.

533
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:39,987
Tomorrow, all right?
I swear, I'll swing by tomorrow.

534
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,950
Andre, these cuffs is too tight, man.

535
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,951
You and me used to be tight.

536
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:49,658
Am I under arrest?
What for?

537
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:54,120
Could you uncuff me, please,
and let me outta here?

538
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,543
You don't have to live like this.

539
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:01,591
There's more than just these projects
out there, you know.

540
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,258
Don't you wanna go someplace
you never been?

541
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:08,006
I mean, you love trains,
but you've only ridden the subway.

542
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,847
Go on, man. Get outta here.

543
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,649
And get them mattresses
for my kids, hear?

544
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:20,818
- Never.
- Never?

545
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,982
You never walked by
on a hot day with your two kids?

546
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:26,701
- Stopped in for a soda?
- With my two kids?

547
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:29,495
I barely see my two kids.
I'm always working.

548
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:32,158
When I get home, I'm exhausted.

549
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,914
Do you have any kids?

550
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,875
Yeah. I have
a two-year-old daughter.

551
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:40,836
Have you ever come home so tired

552
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:44,546
you hated the sound
of your own kids cryin'?

553
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:47,924
Your own flesh and blood.

554
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:51,884
My wife, Sharon, says,
"Quit a job. You got two. "

555
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:55,551
What the hell she thinks I got
two jobs for in the first place?

556
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:58,011
Look, I'm... I'm tryin', man.

557
00:37:58,064 --> 00:38:01,230
I am really tryin'
to move us out of the projects.

558
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,149
You know what I'm sayin'?

559
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:07,689
I'm working, I'm saving,
I'm trying to do the best I can.

560
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:11,652
Provide those ends. I gotta work.

561
00:38:12,702 --> 00:38:15,620
I'm never late. I gotta work.

562
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,247
Victor, listen to me.

563
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:23,458
You're a good, decent,
church-goin', God-fearin' kid.

564
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,627
And if you did pull the trigger,

565
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:30,465
there has to be a reasonable answer
other than what you've told me here.

566
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,674
I gotta ask myself, why would Darryl,
the night manager at Ahab's,

567
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:37,296
try to rob you
in his own parking lot?

568
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,515
So I think it had to be personal.

569
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:45,642
Mm-mm. No.
I never saw him before in my life.

570
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,478
- He flexed, you shot?
- I'm through with it.

571
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:51,647
I told you what happened.
What else do you want?

572
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:54,022
- The truth.
- The truth is lookin' at you!

573
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:58,866
If he did something, if he threatened
your family, this helps you.

574
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:03,739
You were buggin' - "can't sleep,
can't eat". This helps you in court.

575
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,709
What did that prick do to you?

576
00:39:11,006 --> 00:39:13,414
It was self-defence.

577
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:18,007
Self-defence, huh?

578
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:23,555
I wanna see what you see.

579
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:27,437
Uh. I disagree.

580
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,730
I don't think I do look
that fuckin' stupid.

581
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:38,102
Dang, man. In the papers.

582
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:40,943
I thought Vic was legit.
What happened?

583
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:43,199
Boy already had like five jobs.

584
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,658
Aw, shit, man! What the fuck
the homo-cide want now?

585
00:39:57,257 --> 00:40:01,634
235 Hoyt,
Mandela projects, all right?

586
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:04,169
- Yo, Tyrone.
- What's up?

587
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:07,306
Come over here and watch
the car for me, all right?

588
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,267
- All right?
- Yeah, cool. What you gonna give us?

589
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:12,185
Catch you in a little bit.

590
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,306
We ain't gonna do it
for free.

591
00:40:14,357 --> 00:40:16,598
I'll take care
of you later.

592
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:23,072
Excuse me, sir.
Which building is 235 Hoyt?

593
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,403
- Right there.
- Thank you.

594
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:49,344
Is that Nintendo or Sega?

595
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:51,465
- Sega.
- What's it called?

596
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,636
- "Gangsta. "
- Whatever happened to Tiddlywinks?

597
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,102
Rocco, don't you know this is
the new sensation across the nation?

598
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:03,015
- Where you goin'?
- My friend's house.

599
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:07,022
Everybody wants
to be a gangsta, right?

600
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:11,945
Yeah, you like that, right?
You like lookin' at that, right?

601
00:41:11,993 --> 00:41:14,567
- Wanna know how much it costs.
- I know that.

602
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:18,914
Yeah, I'm sure.
Probably want to buy one, right?

603
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,247
How you know I don't got one?

604
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,792
- Why did he have that gun?
- Everybody has one.

605
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,376
- Does he drink a lot?
- He only drank at night.

606
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:29,583
That makes two of us.

607
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:33,670
- How about drugs?
- He's clean as the Board of Health.

608
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:36,557
Did he have
any new friends recently?

609
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,766
- Hangin' out with any new people?
- Not that I know of.

610
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:43,974
You must be thinking of Ronald,
but he hasn't lived here in a while.

611
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,229
- He's quite the athlete.
- Yes.

612
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:49,276
- You boys must be proud of your dad.
- Yes.

613
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,396
I'll bet. Something's not right.

614
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:54,483
When I'm workin' on something,
I gotta make it right.

615
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:58,744
These are my two sons,
Victor and Ronald.

616
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:03,033
Victor's a hard-working,
handsome young man.

617
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:07,329
He doesn't lie. If he said it was
self-defence, it was self-defence.

618
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:09,086
Why don't you believe him?

619
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,751
Do you mind
if I borrow these?

620
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:15,464
I have to go around and retrace
his steps the other night,

621
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:18,084
- and I'd rather not show a mug shot.
- Sure.

622
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:20,925
You be good boys.
Take care of your mother.

623
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:23,844
- Strike.
- You know him?

624
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,018
He's an arrogant piece of shit.

625
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:29,063
Comes into my store all the time
like he craps beige.

626
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:33,733
He used to work with Rodney
last year in his store, with Darryl.

627
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:35,853
Now he runs the crew on the benches.

628
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:38,905
Clocks for Rodney just like Darryl.
Let's bring him in.

629
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:41,618
- What up, man?
- They went to the ninth floor.

630
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,902
Shit! I knew it.

631
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:47,746
- Did they say anything?
- Asked me about "Gangsta".

632
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:49,866
- Anything else?
- Nah.

633
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:52,491
All right, Shorty.
You did good, man.

634
00:42:52,545 --> 00:42:55,296
Go upstairs before your mom
come down flippin'.

635
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,999
All right.

636
00:42:57,925 --> 00:43:00,167
Go on upstairs.

637
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:03,468
- Who you hidin' from?
- Come on, man.

638
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:05,257
What you sneakin' up on me for?

639
00:43:05,307 --> 00:43:07,928
I'm not gonna keep tellin' you
to leave him be.

640
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:10,431
- Tell him!
- How you feel about your brother?

641
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:12,554
It's fucked up, man.

642
00:43:13,606 --> 00:43:16,227
I heard he confessed.
You been to see him?

643
00:43:16,275 --> 00:43:17,900
I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

644
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:21,359
You need to have your stomach
checked out.

645
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:24,738
By the way, my kids thank you
from the bottom of their hearts

646
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:26,776
for their mattresses.

647
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:29,827
Now doesn't that make you feel good?

648
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,118
You know this kid?

649
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:40,918
- Yep. He was in here.
- When?

650
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:43,882
Boy was in here Friday.
He had one drink.

651
00:43:43,926 --> 00:43:47,092
- One drink? Wasn't drunk?
- Nope.

652
00:43:47,137 --> 00:43:50,636
- He was rude.
- Yeah.

653
00:43:52,225 --> 00:43:56,721
'Ooh! I'm just gettin' warmed up.
But it's The Bomb. '

654
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:59,143
Was he with anybody?

655
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,938
He came in alone.
Might've had a conversation.

656
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:05,357
Can't recollect.

657
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,735
Do you recollect the shooting?

658
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:11,320
Hell, yeah.
Who do you think called the cops?

659
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:13,491
So that's who you're lookin' for?

660
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:17,119
Do you remember if the kid was here
before or after the shooting?

661
00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:19,454
He was in here before.
You know how I know?

662
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:23,201
Cos I was watchin' him.
I never saw him before. He was jumpy.

663
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:26,374
Thought he might have been
one of those stick-up kids.

664
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:33,753
This is Strike. Jesus Christ.

665
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:40,261
They don't look alike to me.

666
00:44:40,312 --> 00:44:42,138
What about him?

667
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:46,979
Oh, yeah. Victor? A regular.
What's up with him?

668
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:55,445
Strike, how come you didn't tell me
your brother did it?

669
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,065
Come on, Rodney, man.
What, you forgot?

670
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,820
- You told me you didn't wanna know.
- Yeah, you right.

671
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,495
Victor popped Darryl?.

672
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:09,082
Hey, I don't know if he even did it.

673
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,799
Victor your brother.
You supposed to know.

674
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:14,213
Errol, Errol, just...

675
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,048
We ain't had that conversation
about Darryl, did we?

676
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,677
What conversation?

677
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:25,929
There, you see? Ain't no problem.

678
00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:27,639
Go ahead, man. Break.

679
00:45:35,237 --> 00:45:37,111
That's my boy!

680
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:42,315
Came in one night only,
on the night of the shooting.

681
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:46,947
Has the jumps. Never sat down.
Left sober before the shooting.

682
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:51,415
Yo's jacket shows
possession with intent,

683
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:53,786
possession of unlicensed firearm,

684
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,088
and assault, for which
he still owes three years.

685
00:45:58,134 --> 00:46:01,134
Listen to me, Rocco.
He's all strung out.

686
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:02,969
Has a few schnorts over his limit.

687
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:06,761
He gets fried, walks out of Kool
Breeze with the heater in his bag.

688
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,097
The Adams guy jumps out,
startles him.

689
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:11,516
Pops the first guy
who steps on his Nikes.

690
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,436
It's like a capper on a bad day.

691
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:17,395
That's how these Nubians do it. He
gets religion, comes in, gives it up.

692
00:46:17,443 --> 00:46:19,566
I'm not wasting my time on this.

693
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:23,609
Come on, Larry. Can't you see
what they're tryin' to pull?.

694
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:27,073
Larry. Yo walks in,
says he's the shooter.

695
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,036
No record,
two adorable kids, two jobs.

696
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,487
Model citizen. Claims self-defence.

697
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,375
- OK. All right.
- Who's gonna argue?

698
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:38,834
Now, this other one... Strike.

699
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,008
If he tried that, they'd throw
the key away. He's a known scumbag.

700
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,336
No wonder this sounds like horseshit.
He's lying.

701
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,379
Victor never got off that bar stool.

702
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,135
- Yo was taken away for his brother.
- For what?

703
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,302
Brotherly love?
Fear? For money? What?

704
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:56,760
They ran a game on me, these two,

705
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,434
cos this cocksucker
is an innocent man.

706
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:02,269
Just because a Nubian -
excuse me, Lieutenant -

707
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,438
got a wife, a job, kids,
a dog and a bank account,

708
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,946
he can't be a shooter?

709
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:10,109
You did everything but stick
your tongue down his throat.

710
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:12,994
The kid didn't budge.
Rocco, listen to me.

711
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:16,868
Even if this Victor kid is sellin' us
a line of shit on the tape...

712
00:47:16,915 --> 00:47:20,829
which is what they all do anyhow,
even if they're givin' it up...

713
00:47:20,877 --> 00:47:24,293
this is still a good,
solid "closed by arrest".

714
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:28,122
And if I'm wrong, and Rodney
conspired in on this, or Strike...

715
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:32,588
or the fuckin' Medellín cartel,
I don't give a fuck.

716
00:47:32,638 --> 00:47:34,180
Cos we got the shooter.

717
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:38,387
We locked up the wrong brother.

718
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:42,479
The wrong brother. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, it's on you, OK?

719
00:47:44,941 --> 00:47:49,318
What I want to know is where the fuck
did these yos get balls big enough

720
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:52,031
to think that they could
put this one past me?

721
00:47:52,073 --> 00:47:56,485
I'm tired of hearin' that "yo" shit
from you. Back off.

722
00:47:56,535 --> 00:47:58,693
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Excuse me.
I don't mean any offence.

723
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:03,988
Anybody can bust off an oowop.
What makes Vic any different?

724
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:06,331
Come on, man.
Papers say he had a.38.

725
00:48:06,377 --> 00:48:09,746
- Regardless what the papers say.
- Wait, motherfucker.

726
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:12,881
When was the last time
you bust off an oowop?

727
00:48:12,925 --> 00:48:17,053
I never murdered nobody,
but I'm gonna murder someone now!

728
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:21,389
Yo, yo, chill. Hold it, man. Kill
that noise. Homo-cide creepin' up.

729
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:23,390
How you doin', fellas?

730
00:48:24,478 --> 00:48:27,313
Look who's here.
Ronnie Dunham, big man.

731
00:48:27,355 --> 00:48:30,724
- Ronnie?
- Can I talk to you a minute?

732
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,936
Go on, bitch.

733
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:39,616
I'm Rocco Klein,
DA's Homicide Squad.

734
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:42,615
- You got a minute?
- Homo-cide.

735
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:46,528
I'm doin' the Darryl Adams job.
Your brother, you know?

736
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:48,040
How's he doin'?

737
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,752
Wouldn't know. Haven't seen him yet.

738
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:55,496
That's no joke in there.
You been in?

739
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:59,633
Just overnight on a confusion.
Wasn't no thing.

740
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:07,218
Errol. I thought you were dead.

741
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:10,351
I was. I came back.

742
00:49:10,395 --> 00:49:12,388
Mr Barnes waiting for you?

743
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:14,645
Nah, not me.

744
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:18,398
I'm not happy about this.

745
00:49:18,444 --> 00:49:22,608
Your brother fessed up,
but it was some bullshit explanation.

746
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:24,779
Ronnie, you know what he told us?

747
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:27,696
How the fuck would I know?
I wasn't there.

748
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:32,702
- Wasn't there?
- Where he was telling you all this.

749
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:34,955
What do you think happened?

750
00:49:36,044 --> 00:49:37,918
Got me.

751
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:42,626
You think him and Darryl
had some static? A beef?

752
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:45,545
- Did you know Darryl Adams?
- No, no, no.

753
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:48,381
- You didn't know Darryl Adams?
- Nah, man.

754
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,179
I never met him, nothin'. Nah.

755
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:55,061
When's the last time
you saw your brother?

756
00:49:55,103 --> 00:49:57,974
- It's been a while.
- Week, month, year?

757
00:49:58,023 --> 00:50:00,062
- Yeah.
- Which one?

758
00:50:00,108 --> 00:50:02,231
Two months.

759
00:50:02,277 --> 00:50:04,352
Two months?

760
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,489
You wanna get that?

761
00:50:07,531 --> 00:50:10,947
What you talkin'? That ain't mine.

762
00:50:10,993 --> 00:50:12,867
What do you know?

763
00:50:13,454 --> 00:50:16,407
Ronnie, I was lookin' for
some help, some insight.

764
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:19,030
Your brother's got those kids,

00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,888
Look. Here's my card.

772
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:45,770
You hear anything...

773
00:50:45,817 --> 00:50:48,308

00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:29,931
Yeah, all right.

782
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:40,363

785
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:49,784

786
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:53,334

- Nothin' you don't do for yourself.

787
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,044
Strike, my man!
This is a new day, Strike.

Dinkins out, Rudy in. Law and order.
Cut the budget. Party's over.

789

Crackdown on drugs, crime, niggers,

790
00:52:04,974 --> 00:52:09,137
spics, homeless, squeegeemen,
African-Americans.

00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:12,352
Have a seat. So what's up?

792
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:14,271
Not a thing, Detective.

793
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:16,723
Detective? Call me Jo-Jo.

794
00:52:16,776 --> 00:52:19,528
You like basketball?.

795
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,896
Nah. I don't like sports.

796
00:52:21,948 --> 00:52:25,482

797
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:29,947

802
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:45,549
We're coming down on these projects
like a fuckin' broom.

803
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,880
So if I was you,
I'd take my homies out, say 9pm,

804
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:52,347

809
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:05,774
I look out for you,

810
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:13,369
- You look like 500.
- 500. That's a start.

811
00:53:13,412 --> 00:53:16,448
Good. Every week, I look out for you.

812
00:53:16,498 --> 00:53:21,076
I tell you when we're hittin'. Week

813
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:23,085

814
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:25,288
This is my man Kirby.

815
00:53:28,217 --> 00:53:31,633
Kirby gonna double back in
like 30 minutes. You lay it on him.

816
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,388
You tell your boy Rodney
I got some good stuff he could use.

817
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:39,220
Finest, highest quality.

818
00:53:41,313 --> 00:53:43,389
Peace out.

819
00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:55,573
I think you dropped this.

820
00:53:55,618 --> 00:53:58,369
If I was you,
I think I'd call this guy.

821
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:00,949
Larry.

822
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,283
Yo, Strike.

823
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:21,634
- Been waiting for 40 minutes...
- Who's here to see Victor Dunham?

824
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:29,097
You told me he was gonna
come down a half-hour ago.

825
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:31,984
Watch your tone,
young lady.

826
00:54:45,956 --> 00:54:48,494
Aw, man. I love you. I love you, man.

827
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:50,997
- Cool, man.
- You look good.

828
00:54:55,006 --> 00:54:56,880
After you, man.

829
00:55:01,762 --> 00:55:03,885
Somebody got bored shaving.

830
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:07,809
So they decided
to cut me up with a razor.

831
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,395
And they stole my sneakers, too.

832
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,395
Yo, big brother.

833
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,818
You made the papers, man.

834
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:37,082
Ronnie...
Can you get me outta here, man?

835
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:40,960
- I'll try. What's the bail?.
- 50,000.

836
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:43,580
50?! God damn!

837
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:47,921
- What's the cash options?
- My lawyer says maybe in a week...

838
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:51,388
I can get that, um,
that ten per cent thing.

839
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:53,260
- Maybe Rodney got...
- Rodney?

840
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,513
Tell motherfuckers
to stop fuckin' with you.

841
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:59,897
Yeah, man.
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.

842
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:05,486
Look, man, I'm gonna try
to get you outta here, OK?

843
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:10,108
Ronnie, some of these brothers...
some of these men...

844
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,949
they love jail, man.

845
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:16,411
But all this, this ain't for me, man.

846
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,989
I'm gonna get you
outta here, all right?

847
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,338
You kiss my babies for me, please?

848
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:34,176
- All right.
- Thank you.

849
00:56:38,644 --> 00:56:41,395
We've been open
for about a year.

850
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:45,184
We've done pretty well so far.

851
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:51,107
When I read about it,
my heart was broken.

852
00:56:51,156 --> 00:56:52,899
Victor is a sweetheart.

853
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:56,152
- Was he ever late for work?
- Never. Like Swiss movement.

854
00:56:56,202 --> 00:56:58,740
- Did he ever steal?.
- No, he was honest.

855
00:56:58,788 --> 00:57:01,492
- Get any visitors?
- No.

856
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,417
See him in here?

857
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:07,920
No.

858
00:57:07,963 --> 00:57:11,877
Victor was my buffer.
He could talk and reason with them.

859
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:14,842
Anybody ever threaten him?

860
00:57:14,886 --> 00:57:17,211
Open up your eyes
and realise things is tough

861
00:57:17,263 --> 00:57:20,264
Your shit is my rough
when you livin' in the city

862
00:57:20,308 --> 00:57:22,715
Walk with your head high
step with the bitty-bop

863
00:57:22,768 --> 00:57:25,555
Got to survive
when you slam or you do or die

864
00:57:25,604 --> 00:57:28,177
Cos niggers try to read through
a nigger's eyes...

865
00:57:28,232 --> 00:57:30,604
May I help you?

866
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,770
- May I help you?
- Yeah, let me the fuck in the store.

867
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,105
This is a store, right?
People buy shit in the store.

868
00:57:37,157 --> 00:57:40,739
- What do you wish to buy, brother?
- I wish to buy what you got.

869
00:57:42,411 --> 00:57:44,451
Maybe we don't have what you want.

870
00:57:44,497 --> 00:57:47,782
Unbelievable. What are you,
the security house nigger?

871
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:51,284
- What? They rent you by the hour?
- We're just trying to help...

872
00:57:51,336 --> 00:57:52,581
Fuck that, man!

873
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:56,496
Cos I'm black, that automatically
mean I'm gonna steal something.

874
00:57:56,549 --> 00:57:59,883
Nigger, I came in here
to buy a birthday gift for my mom!

875
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:01,505
But you ain't shit

00:58:01,554 --> 00:58:04,839
and neither is this bullshit kung fu
Chinese bitch store!

877
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,635
Fuck you, motherfucker!

878
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:11,889
I'm gonna bring my steel
and pump bullets in your ass.

879
00:58:11,939 --> 00:58:13,184
Think I'm playing?

880
00:58:13,232 --> 00:58:16,517
You disrespectin' me
on my mother's birthday... nigger!

881
00:58:16,568 --> 00:58:19,141
Listen up, man.

882
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,939
How much you make in a month?

883
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:25,734
See this? See this?
It's a hundred dollar bill, right?

884
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:29,903
Use it in your kid's birthday.

885
00:58:29,955 --> 00:58:33,953
I'm gonna come back here.
I'm gonna kill your ass.

886
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:35,661
Thank you.

887
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,958
I'm gonna kill your ass.

888
00:58:41,299 --> 00:58:44,917
- What did he want?
- Nothin'.

889
00:58:46,846 --> 00:58:51,140
- Did that kid ever come back?
- No.

890
00:58:58,398 --> 00:59:02,526
- Hey, what's up, Mr Brown?
- Hey, Mr Dunham.

891
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:05,735
Yo, Ty, that's my landlord,
Mr Brown. Say, what's up?

892
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,734
- How you doing, sir?
- Pleased to meet you, young man.

893
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:11,108
This is Tyrone.
This is my little brother.

894
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:14,743
Anybody bother you, and his head's
out here, you let me know.

895
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:17,706
I got something
for the crackheads my damn self.

896
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,083
You do like your big brother.
Leave those drugs alone.

897
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:23,749
Hey, I got some food on the stove.
See ya later.

898
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:28,375
All right. Peace.
Now, go up the steps. Hurry up.

899
00:59:30,637 --> 00:59:33,637
Hey, Shorty.
What you doin'? Don't touch that.

900
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:36,931
Buggin'. You know anything
about what you're touchin'?

901
00:59:36,976 --> 00:59:39,182
No!

902
00:59:40,146 --> 00:59:41,521
Little buster.

903
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,353
Lionel Trains, right?
They was built in the early 1900s.

904
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:51,482
But them cheap shits,
they only ran on dry cell batteries.

905
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:54,615
But, yo, after World War II,

906
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:58,988
when more folks started getting
electricity in their cribs,

907
00:59:59,038 --> 01:00:01,873
boom, they made the new ones.

908
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:05,166
Yeah, phat, right?
Yeah.

909
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:09,789
Yo, profit's all in the cut.
Don't never forget that.

910
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:15,423
Yo, Shorty, if I ever see
or even hear about you

911
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:20,013
messin' with this stuff right here,
man, sniffin' or pipin' up...

912
01:00:20,057 --> 01:00:23,094
Yo, come here, man.

913
01:00:23,144 --> 01:00:24,970
The word to my mother.

914
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:31,600
Put a cap in your ass.

915
01:00:31,652 --> 01:00:34,652
This ain't no TV movie
violence bullshit neither.

916
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,487
This stuff out here is real.

917
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:39,781
Real bullets hurt.
And real guns kills you dead.

918
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:43,610
See this right here?
This is.25 automatic.

919
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,490
I keeps this for all them
ill niggers out there.

920
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:51,993
Like that one dude Errol.
Now that brother's crazy.

921
01:00:52,045 --> 01:00:54,963
He will blast your ass,
just won't give a fuck.

922
01:00:55,007 --> 01:00:58,043
The messed-up thing is
that they never find the body.

923
01:00:58,093 --> 01:01:00,132
Just the blood stains on the ground.

924
01:01:00,178 --> 01:01:03,381
If he ever try to creep up on me,
I'm gonna gat his ass.

925
01:01:03,431 --> 01:01:05,673
You best be ready
to do the same shit, too.

926
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:08,679
Aw, don't think
that just cos you're 12,

927
01:01:08,728 --> 01:01:12,346
small and shit,
that he won't smoke you.

928
01:01:12,398 --> 01:01:15,268
Just last year,
he caught himself a ten-year-old.

929
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:19,231
I knows you probably thinking about
what Mr Brown said earlier and all.

930
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:21,900
But, chill, don't even
sweat that shit, man.

931
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:24,902
He's old and po'.
He don't know what time it is.

932
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:27,193
This is how you get
that money right here.

933
01:01:27,245 --> 01:01:30,032
How do you think I got
that phat-ass train set?

934
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:32,369
From pumpin'
this white shit right here.

935
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:35,334
Any fly shit you want
in this world, it costs money.

936
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:40,833
And this is how you get it. Hustling.
Don't never forget that shit neither.

937
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:48,471
Yo, Shorty, you're smart, right?
Well, answer me this.

938
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:52,973
Boss buys him a key
for $22,000, right?

939
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:56,387
Cuts it up to 3,500 $10 bottles.

940
01:01:56,438 --> 01:02:02,311
Boss takes 60%, $17,000 profit,
leaving up $7,000,

941
01:02:02,361 --> 01:02:04,437
50% of which is mine.

942
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,731
How much for me?

943
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,946
3,500.

944
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:16,831
My man, Shorty.
Keep hittin' them books, all right?

945
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:18,154
All right.

946
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:21,957
If I ever catch you playing hooky,
I'll put a cap in your ass.

947
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:25,586
My name is M-O
and don't you forget it

948
01:02:25,632 --> 01:02:28,918
Takin' out your boys
and you don't know how I did it

949
01:02:28,969 --> 01:02:31,638
Pickin' off your crew one by one

950
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,214
Don't step in my way
cos I just might have a gun

951
01:02:35,266 --> 01:02:38,350
May be loaded just might not be

952
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:40,849
Cos I'm a menace to society

953
01:02:40,896 --> 01:02:44,063
My name not Thiggy-thiggy
but I still get hip

954
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:47,393
- So back the fuck up and just
- Chill

955
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:50,314
Cos steppin' on me
you'll be a-writin' your will

956
01:02:50,363 --> 01:02:53,281
I'm like an Energizer
can't never die

957
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:56,740
Ba, ba, ba, ba, nice try

958
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:59,870
Ha, ha, ha,
I saw you run in the building

959
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:02,950
Throwing up my guns
to the ceiling

960
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,787
Ba, ba, ba, here I go again

961
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:08,588
Ba, ba, ba, cops are comin' in

962
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,335
Run into the back, man
I'm fast up the staircase

963
01:03:11,383 --> 01:03:12,925
I got no time to waste

964
01:03:12,968 --> 01:03:16,171
Nobody seen my face
so I leave without a trace...

965
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:22,970
Make the drops over on Smith Street
from now on.

966
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:24,727
Yeah, all right.

967
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,557
Oh, yeah, crooked-ass Jo-Jo.

968
01:03:27,606 --> 01:03:30,144
He said he got
some weight for you to buy.

969
01:03:30,192 --> 01:03:32,564
Forget that motherfucker.

970
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:36,359
Fuckin' faggot.
He tapped me up for $500, too.

971
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:45,032
Errol told me you talked
to the homicide cop.

972
01:03:45,873 --> 01:03:48,494
- How'd that go?
- It was aight.

973
01:03:50,878 --> 01:03:52,870
"Aight" or all right?

974
01:03:53,672 --> 01:03:57,088
It was "aight," all right?

975
01:04:05,183 --> 01:04:08,219
I ever tell you about
the first time I killed somebody?

976
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:09,384
Nah.

977
01:04:09,437 --> 01:04:11,429
Errol Barnes made me do it...

978
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:14,976
cos it was three guys burned us
on some bogus dope.

979
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:20,733
'Errol's already killed
the other two, right?

980
01:04:20,781 --> 01:04:22,061
'We got the third guy. '

981
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:25,733
Be cool, man.
Chill, motherfucker, chill.

982
01:04:25,785 --> 01:04:27,908
Ain't you all sorry
you fucked with us?

983
01:04:27,954 --> 01:04:29,282
I ain't fucked with you.

984
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,533
You're lucky we don't blow your ass
off like them crackers down South.

985
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:35,869
- Look, I hate this shit, man.
- What the fuck is my name?

986
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,493
- Errol, man.
- You're goddam right.

987
01:04:38,547 --> 01:04:40,789
'Motherfucker
crying like a baby.

988
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:43,296
'Tears, snot flying, and shit.
Errol turned to me. '

989
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:47,969
Says, "You got
to cap him, or I'm gonna cap you. "

990
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:51,300
Man, come on, that shit
ain't necessary, man.

991
01:04:51,351 --> 01:04:54,933
'I ain't gonna cap that boy.
He's scared like a motherfucker. '

992
01:04:54,979 --> 01:04:58,395
You think I'm playin' with you?
Open your mouth.

993
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:00,350
You gonna take this piece...

994
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:03,401
and you're gonna put that
motherfucker's brains out.

995
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:07,063
- You understand me?!
- I got it.

996
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:10,826
Go to it.

997
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,241
I said you shouldn't
have did that shit, man.

998
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:17,202
- Come on, please! Please!
- On three, Rodney.

999
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,740
I can't stop my hand from shakin'.

1000
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:23,921
- Don't you chump out on me.
- I can't stop my hand from shakin'!

1001
01:05:23,964 --> 01:05:25,921
- Cap him!
- All right!

1002
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:27,590
Please...

1003
01:05:31,054 --> 01:05:33,723
Don't you wish
you'd done us right?

1004
01:05:33,765 --> 01:05:38,225
Hey, hey, hey. Don't you
ever, ever fuck with me, boy.

1005
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:44,181
Do you know me now? I'm a bad man.

1006
01:05:44,233 --> 01:05:47,981
Errol couldn't have me runnin'
around here knowin' what he did

1007
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:51,313
without somethin' personal
hangin' over my head, too.

1008
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:53,653
Personal, Strike.

1009
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,069
Otherwise, I might give him up
someday, you understand?

1010
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,582
Strike, that's the reason why

1011
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:06,836
I needed you to be bloody
on this Darryl thing.

1012
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,998
You hear me?

1013
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,213
'Errol Barnes, boy. '

1014
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,842
Motherfucker had a sawed-off
shotgun right in my mug, Strike.

1015
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:19,924
He's my best friend, too.

1016
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:26,521
- What's the matter with you?
- Shit!

1017
01:06:30,025 --> 01:06:32,101
You gotta take care of yourself.

1018
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:35,189
Here. Wipe that off.

1019
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,614
You OK?

1020
01:06:39,492 --> 01:06:42,742
You ain't seen my doctor, have you?

1021
01:06:42,787 --> 01:06:45,954
- Huh?
- Nah.

1022
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:51,075
Strike, why I got to tell you things
two and three and four times, huh?

1023
01:06:51,128 --> 01:06:53,833
Why you don't want to listen to me?

1024
01:06:55,007 --> 01:06:56,880
You OK?

1025
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,679
Shit.

1026
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:05,386
To be honest, I don't really
give a fuck because you lied to me.

1027
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:09,644
Lied about what? You said Darryl
had a drug problem, a crackhead.

1028
01:07:09,687 --> 01:07:12,558
I asked around. The guy was clean.

1029
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:14,646
I was just speculatin'.

1030
01:07:14,692 --> 01:07:17,099
That's some nasty-ass speculatin'.

1031
01:07:20,572 --> 01:07:23,739
Damn. You're comin'
at me with mad questions.

1032
01:07:23,784 --> 01:07:26,025
I'm just tryin'
to answer them shits.

1033
01:07:26,077 --> 01:07:29,280
Then you said you never met 'im.

1034
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:31,537
Maybe just by eye, all right?

1035
01:07:31,582 --> 01:07:35,794
"Just by eye. "
You and him never had any static?

1036
01:07:35,836 --> 01:07:37,496
Naw.

1037
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:41,496
There's no way Victor could've been
cuttin' through the parking lot

1038
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:44,716
in the dark, and Darryl would've
mistaken him for you?

1039
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,469
Naw, man.

1040
01:07:46,513 --> 01:07:48,755
Cos you and your brother,
in the dark,

1041
01:07:48,807 --> 01:07:50,965
probably look like two peas in a pod.

1042
01:07:51,017 --> 01:07:54,302
What the fuck you sayin'?
All black people look alike at night?

1043
01:07:54,354 --> 01:07:57,722
I can't even tell you guys
apart in the day.

1044
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,896
Hey, you got jokes.

1045
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,943
- You and your brother close?
- Not really.

1046
01:08:02,987 --> 01:08:06,854
I forgot. Long-lost brothers.
When was the last time?

1047
01:08:06,907 --> 01:08:09,528
A month.

1048
01:08:09,576 --> 01:08:12,327
Strike, you told me
two months before.

1049
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,742
If you know so much,
why you keep asking?

1050
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:17,825
- You know what Alzheimer's is?
- Some kind of beer?

1051
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:20,746
Wise guy. You visit him yet?

1052
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:23,123
Yeah.

1053
01:08:23,964 --> 01:08:25,957
He's claimin' self-defence.

1054
01:08:26,008 --> 01:08:29,840
He goes to trial with that,
those two nice kids of his,

1055
01:08:29,886 --> 01:08:33,089
by the time he'll be gettin'
out, they'll be goin' in.

1056
01:08:33,139 --> 01:08:36,259
Did it ever occur to you
maybe he didn't even do the shit?

1057
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:37,720
You know who did?

1058
01:08:37,769 --> 01:08:40,224
Who did it?

1059
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:42,809
Come on, man, I gotta go. I'm sick.

1060
01:08:45,151 --> 01:08:48,068
- Here's my card.
- Got two already.

1061
01:08:49,363 --> 01:08:51,688
You better have that checked out.

1062
01:08:56,995 --> 01:08:59,153
Hey, what the fuck y'all lookin' at?

1063
01:09:00,915 --> 01:09:02,196
Oh, shit!

1064
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:04,666
You all right, man?

1065
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:10,581
Strike! Strike! You smokin' crack,
motherfucker, huh?

1066
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:12,791
Get the fuck up!

1067
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:18,462
Get an ambulance, man!
Let's get an ambulance!

1068
01:09:18,515 --> 01:09:20,887
Let's get him the hell
outta here.

1069
01:09:20,934 --> 01:09:23,721
He'll be all right. He'll be fine.
Watch it, guys.

1070
01:09:25,605 --> 01:09:29,187
One, two, three.
Let's go!

1071
01:09:30,026 --> 01:09:32,351
Here you go. It's all right, man.

1072
01:09:32,403 --> 01:09:35,320
- Hit that pipe today?
- Dice that shit. He don't use.

1073
01:09:35,364 --> 01:09:38,483
Anyone ever tell you not to do drugs?
Where do you live?

1074
01:09:38,533 --> 01:09:41,487
I'll give you that.
Just get him to hospital.

1075
01:09:41,536 --> 01:09:44,656
Welcome to Ahab's.
May I take your order, please?

1076
01:09:44,706 --> 01:09:47,244
Yes,
we need a Double Whaler on a bun.

1077
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:49,450
'With cheese?'

1078
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:52,953
Yes, with cheese.
A fried shrimp boat.

1079
01:09:53,005 --> 01:09:54,583
'One fried shrimp boat. '

1080
01:09:54,632 --> 01:09:55,830
- Two.
- Yeah, two.

1081
01:09:55,883 --> 01:09:57,294
'Two fried shrimp... '

1082
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:04,420
Uh, could I please get my
Captain Ahab with a clam roll?.

1083
01:10:04,474 --> 01:10:07,095
- Captain Ahab, Captain...
- What's up, boys?

1084
01:10:07,143 --> 01:10:10,263
Hey, it's a nice car you got.

1085
01:10:10,313 --> 01:10:13,267
- Yeah, it's my dad's car.
- How ya doin'?

1086
01:10:13,316 --> 01:10:15,641
Power windows,
air bags, cellular phone.

1087
01:10:15,693 --> 01:10:18,362
Bet he paid a pretty penny for this.

1088
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:21,737
Oh, yeah. We were lookin'
for the Short Hills Mall.

1089
01:10:21,782 --> 01:10:23,858
- It's not here.
- No?

1090
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:26,863
Come down from Connecticut
just to buy some whiting?

1091
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:29,034
Some golf balls.

1092
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,998
You buy anything else around here
I should know about?

1093
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:33,998
- Some gum.
- No.

1094
01:10:34,043 --> 01:10:36,451
You like soul food?

1095
01:10:36,504 --> 01:10:38,580
Can't say I do.

1096
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:42,130
- You like to wear lipstick?
- Todd, why don't we get outta here?

1097
01:10:42,176 --> 01:10:44,845
McCauley does
in the back... occasionally.

1098
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:47,674
- You like skirts?
- Something we did wrong?

1099
01:10:47,723 --> 01:10:50,640
- You ever suck a black man's dick?
- Let's get outta here!

1100
01:10:50,684 --> 01:10:54,017
A big, 16-inch tar baby?

1101
01:10:54,062 --> 01:10:56,220
- No?
- No.

1102
01:10:56,272 --> 01:10:59,807
If I toss this car and I find any
drugs, I got 12 baboons in a cage

1103
01:10:59,859 --> 01:11:02,895
who are gonna be callin'
you boys Mary all night.

1104
01:11:02,945 --> 01:11:04,736
- Come on, Todd.
- Shut up, man!

1105
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,485
- Who's got the drugs?
- We don't have anything.

1106
01:11:07,533 --> 01:11:09,905
- You got five seconds.
- Todd's got the drugs!

1107
01:11:09,952 --> 01:11:12,952
- Shut up, man!
- Todd's got the drugs.

1108
01:11:12,996 --> 01:11:15,617
- Fuck you guys, man!
- Put your hands on the car.

1109
01:11:15,665 --> 01:11:17,871
- Take it easy!
- Fucking cocksucker!

1110
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:21,701
Fucking touch him again, I'll rip
your throat out. Get your hands up.

1111
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:38,886
- What's up?
- You tell me.

1112
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:41,013
What you up to, man?

1113
01:11:41,064 --> 01:11:44,017
You the one involved
in all the drama out here.

1114
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,649
How you always know
when I'm comin' out of somewhere?

1115
01:11:47,695 --> 01:11:50,945
Don't you know I know everything?

1116
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:53,397
Didn't I tell you
to go see my doctor?

1117
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:56,367
Didn't I tell you to stop
drinkin' that Moo shit?

1118
01:11:56,411 --> 01:11:59,780
Yeah, you did, you did.
No doubt, man, no doubt.

1119
01:11:59,831 --> 01:12:03,164
- How you so smart and so stupid?
- Cut me some slack.

1120
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:06,412
I heard that Homicide came back
on you again yesterday.

1121
01:12:06,462 --> 01:12:08,585
He ain't sayin' I'm in.
He's just fishin'.

1122
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:10,291
You and him fuck buddies now?

1123
01:12:10,341 --> 01:12:14,125
- You got jokes, man.
- Come on, get in, get in.

1124
01:12:18,557 --> 01:12:21,890
- How do you feel?.
- I'm all right.

1125
01:12:23,103 --> 01:12:26,269
You better be, cos we got
another big order come in.

1126
01:12:27,357 --> 01:12:29,314
Hey, Rod.

1127
01:12:33,612 --> 01:12:37,313
If God created anything better
than crack cocaine,

1128
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:40,201
he kept that shit for hisself.

1129
01:12:41,745 --> 01:12:44,283
I mean, that shit
is like truth serum.

1130
01:12:44,331 --> 01:12:46,572
It will truly expose who you are.

1131
01:12:46,624 --> 01:12:50,622
I mean, you happen to be
a low-life rat bastard motherfucker,

1132
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:54,288
who will sell off his newborn
for a suck off that glass dick,

1133
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,795
crack will bring it
right on in the light.

1134
01:12:56,842 --> 01:13:00,009
I don't care you black,
white, Chinese, rich, poor.

1135
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:02,591
You take that first hit,
you on a mission.

1136
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:05,011
And that mission will never end.

1137
01:13:05,058 --> 01:13:08,723
Even when the house,
the money, loved ones are gone,

1138
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:12,684
they send you to the joint,
you still gonna try to cop.

1139
01:13:12,732 --> 01:13:14,606
No doubt.

1140
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:19,893
Only time it ends, Strike, that
mission, when you six feet under.

1141
01:13:19,947 --> 01:13:23,991
That's the reason I don't ever want
to hear about you using this shit.

1142
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:26,869
- You understand me?
- You crazy?

1143
01:13:26,912 --> 01:13:28,703
All right, then.

1144
01:13:28,747 --> 01:13:33,243
Cos it's also the reason why
I ain't never goin' outta business.

1145
01:13:33,293 --> 01:13:35,914
I'm a great businessman, Strike.

1146
01:13:35,962 --> 01:13:39,128
And I got me the world's
greatest product.

1147
01:13:41,509 --> 01:13:43,335
Now you think about that.

1148
01:13:47,514 --> 01:13:48,843
Yo, so what up?

1149
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,598
I'm gonna see you at the store.

1150
01:13:50,642 --> 01:13:52,931
- Go ahead.
- All right.

1151
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:59,354
You believe I used to deal with that
woman when she looked like somethin'?

1152
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,602
Yeah. You didn't know that, did you?

1153
01:14:03,654 --> 01:14:05,481
She used to look good, right?

1154
01:14:05,531 --> 01:14:08,982
She looked better than she look now.

1155
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:21,245
- Finest shit we got today.
- Let me see.

1156
01:14:21,296 --> 01:14:24,498
- Yeah.
- 50 dollars.

1157
01:14:24,549 --> 01:14:27,300
But ain't y'all pregnant,
though, y'all?.

1158
01:14:27,343 --> 01:14:30,260
- You got to maintain that, man.
- We already know that.

1159
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:32,759
That's the last
I'm gonna sell to y'all.

1160
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:35,297
Y'all got to take care
of that little girl.

1161
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,934
Got red caps?

1162
01:14:43,983 --> 01:14:46,355
I'm getting tired
of these nickels, man.

1163
01:14:46,402 --> 01:14:49,652
Where the dimes at, Lou?
We don't got it like that.

1164
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,613
Come on, let's do this.

1165
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,738
You got it?

1166
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,395
I got reds and I got yellows.

1167
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,597
- What you need?
- Two yellow ones.

1168
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,725
- Want two yellows?
- I want two reds.

1169
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:34,395
All right, Veronica. Slow down, girl.
Why you in such a hurry?

1170
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,981
- Because I wanna get out of here.
- Wanna get outta here?

1171
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,358
- Let me see this money.
- No, I said two.

1172
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:44,033
- Let me see the money. Chill.
- I want yellow.

1173
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,073
- You want yellows?
- I want reds.

1174
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:49,291
It's the same shit. Both
of 'em just to crack your ass up.

1175
01:15:49,335 --> 01:15:51,957
- I want three of 'em.
- And I said two.

1176
01:16:05,934 --> 01:16:09,517
You notice the tablecloths out there,
with the African prints?

1177
01:16:09,563 --> 01:16:13,145
The nice carpeting and the plants
hanging from the ceilings?

1178
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:15,729
It's all Victor's ideas.

1179
01:16:15,777 --> 01:16:20,984
You see, Victor always wanted to make
this place like somebody's home.

1180
01:16:21,031 --> 01:16:23,522
He treated everybody with respect.

1181
01:16:23,576 --> 01:16:27,490
The workers, the customers...
even the clockers.

1182
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:31,368
Like, you asked me
about last Friday night.

1183
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:33,788
'We got three
cocolo chocho face maricones

1184
01:16:33,835 --> 01:16:37,168
'trying to set up shop out there,
right in front of my business. '

1185
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:42,551
I reach for my... trusty Roberto
Clemente Louisville Slugger here,

1186
01:16:42,593 --> 01:16:46,258
and I'm ready to bash in a head,
I'm ready to bash in an arm.

1187
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:48,132
But Victor, Victor, he says...

1188
01:16:48,182 --> 01:16:51,847
No, Jesus, no.
Let me handle them, please.

1189
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:56,394
We set somebody up
in the bathroom there.

1190
01:16:56,439 --> 01:16:59,606
Put somebody over there
as a lookout in the window.

1191
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:02,188
Sorry, but you brothers
can't clock in here.

1192
01:17:02,236 --> 01:17:05,735
This is a family place,
and I need you to respect that.

1193
01:17:05,781 --> 01:17:09,826
Here. Take these jumbo sodas.
This is a Pepsi.

1194
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:14,319
An orange. A root beer.

1195
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:18,866
I would appreciate it very much...

1196
01:17:18,918 --> 01:17:22,252
if you would leave when
you finish your jumbo sodas.

1197
01:17:22,297 --> 01:17:26,080
Usually they would just be happy
to get the free jumbo sodas,

1198
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:30,427
but on this night, Leroy pulls out
a roll this big and says...

1199
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:36,556
My boss says that he'll pay you $300
a week if you let us set up here.

1200
01:17:39,646 --> 01:17:41,224
What did he say?

1201
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:46,693
Victor puts please and thank you into
every sentence. So, it was either...

1202
01:17:46,736 --> 01:17:48,396
No. Please, thank you.

1203
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:51,482
- Or...
- Please. No, thank you.

1204
01:17:51,532 --> 01:17:54,817
What? You tryin' to be fuckin'
burger boy of the month, man?

1205
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:59,909
Wait. Your girlfriend likes you
smellin' like burgers?

1206
01:17:59,957 --> 01:18:01,451
No. My wife...

1207
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:06,327
Oh, your wife, your wife.
Got it. I see, OK, look.

1208
01:18:06,379 --> 01:18:08,704
We're tryin' to do something here.

1209
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:09,919
I can respect that.

1210
01:18:09,966 --> 01:18:13,381
You take your business outside,
and I'll handle my business inside.

1211
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:17,294
You can't even smile, man. You don't
like this job. Feel that money.

1212
01:18:17,348 --> 01:18:21,345
- It's power.
- I need you to respect that.

1213
01:18:24,729 --> 01:18:26,686
I'm gonna miss you, man.

1214
01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:29,981
So, I have to check the floor.
I got a business to run.

1215
01:18:30,026 --> 01:18:33,609
- So, Hay-sus...
- I pronounce it "Jesus".

1216
01:18:33,654 --> 01:18:36,228
I feel more comfortable
calling you "Hay-sus".

1217
01:18:36,282 --> 01:18:40,066
My mother called me Jesus, my father
called me Jesus. You call me Jesus.

1218
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:43,819
All right, Jesus. So is that why
Victor left early Friday?

1219
01:18:43,872 --> 01:18:45,699
He said he wasn't feeling well.

1220
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:51,502
- Fuck. I gotta make a call.
- There's a phone out in front.

1221
01:18:51,546 --> 01:18:53,337
Wasn't feeling well?.

1222
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:57,378
Would you feel well after working
65 hours a week in a place like this?

1223
01:18:57,426 --> 01:19:00,427
It'll make you sick. Try it. Give me
your badge, I'll give you my apron.

1224
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,171
How much cheese
you make yesterday, yo?

1225
01:19:04,224 --> 01:19:07,309
I made like a motherfuckin' yard.
I did all right.

1226
01:19:07,352 --> 01:19:09,890
- Yo, Strike!
- Here comes Shorty.

1227
01:19:09,938 --> 01:19:12,014
- Take this.
- Shorty, what I told you?

1228
01:19:12,065 --> 01:19:13,310
It's yours.

1229
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:14,982
I told you!

1230
01:19:15,026 --> 01:19:16,900
- Here comes your moms.
- Oh, shit.

1231
01:19:16,945 --> 01:19:18,902
- It's yours.
- You crazy?

1232
01:19:18,946 --> 01:19:22,315
- What did I say? Huh? You hear me?
- What are you doin'?

1233
01:19:22,366 --> 01:19:26,316
You hear me? I told you!
You leave my son alone!

1234
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:29,536
Don't you ever put your motherfuckin'
hands in my face.

1235
01:19:29,581 --> 01:19:32,452
I will put my hands
wherever I want to!

1236
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,540
You stop buying him shit.

1237
01:19:34,586 --> 01:19:36,578
I ain't buyin' him shit.

1238
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:40,293
- Fuck!
- Go home. Go!

1239
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:43,840
The Nikes,
the Sega game, the haircut!

1240
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:46,635
You thought you were slick, right?

1241
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:50,014
I saw him riding the bike.
You wouldn't let him bring that home.

1242
01:19:50,059 --> 01:19:52,846
You best stay the fuck
out of my face.

1243
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:57,437
I am not scared of you.
Maybe you're scared of Andre.

1244
01:19:57,482 --> 01:19:59,391
You get Andre. I don't give a fuck.

1245
01:19:59,442 --> 01:20:04,104
You are sellin'
your own people death.

1246
01:20:04,614 --> 01:20:08,113
All of y'all. I'm not gonna let you
take him with you.

1247
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,531
You hear me?
I can't let you do that.

1248
01:20:10,578 --> 01:20:13,199
I can't let you do that.

1249
01:20:14,206 --> 01:20:16,827
Can't! You understand?

1250
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,081
I'm gonna go get Andre.

1251
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:23,746
She took a pop at him, the ho.

1252
01:20:25,216 --> 01:20:27,458
Yeah, here come your friend, man.

1253
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:30,427
Now you're beatin' up
on defenceless women?

1254
01:20:30,471 --> 01:20:33,804
- What gives?
- Come on, man. She attacked me.

1255
01:20:34,892 --> 01:20:37,383
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have a seat.

1256
01:20:39,604 --> 01:20:43,222
Don't look so depressed.
Worse things could happen.

1257
01:20:47,487 --> 01:20:52,991
Hey, Ronnie, have I treated you
like a hard-on out here?

1258
01:20:53,034 --> 01:20:54,611
What?

1259
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,949
Have I not treated you
like a man out here?

1260
01:20:56,996 --> 01:20:59,866
Talked to you
with respect, courtesy, huh?

1261
01:20:59,915 --> 01:21:01,658
What you talkin' about?

1262
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:03,997
Why you tryin' to make
a fuckin' fool outta me?

1263
01:21:04,044 --> 01:21:06,998
- What you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

1264
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:09,253
You told me you
didn't know Darryl Adams.

1265
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:13,166
I'm running around like
a horse's ass on that.

1266
01:21:13,219 --> 01:21:15,591
Not only did I find out
that you know him,

1267
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:18,639
but you worked a year with him
at Rodney's store.

1268
01:21:18,682 --> 01:21:20,591
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

1269
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:23,098
I thought you meant
this other Darryl.

1270
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:24,722
What other Darryl?.

1271
01:21:24,771 --> 01:21:26,431
If you knew some other Darryl,

1272
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:29,233
you should have said,
"Yeah, I know him," right?

1273
01:21:29,276 --> 01:21:32,395
- I don't get it.
- I only know one Darryl.

1274
01:21:32,445 --> 01:21:35,481
You said you didn't see
your brother in two months.

1275
01:21:35,531 --> 01:21:37,239
- Oh, God.
- You got all kind...

1276
01:21:37,283 --> 01:21:40,237
What? Ronnie, don't "Oh, God" me.

1277
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:43,820
You got all kinds of pissed off
at me just like you are now,

1278
01:21:43,872 --> 01:21:47,039
- cos I forgot you said that, right?
- Yeah.

1279
01:21:47,084 --> 01:21:48,827
Well, guess what?

1280
01:21:48,877 --> 01:21:50,501
I go into the Kool Breeze,

1281
01:21:50,545 --> 01:21:53,996
the bar your brother was in
just before the shootin',

1282
01:21:54,048 --> 01:21:57,749
the bartender ID'd you
in there that night.

1283
01:21:57,802 --> 01:22:00,553
He even remembered the drink
he made for you.

1284
01:22:00,596 --> 01:22:04,676
Pina colada, straight out of a can.
Does this ring a bell?.

1285
01:22:05,392 --> 01:22:07,349
Why did you lie to me?

1286
01:22:07,394 --> 01:22:10,597
- Cos man, it's my brother.
- What's your brother?

1287
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:12,355
Your brother made you lie?

1288
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,356
Tryin' to look out for him.

1289
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:17,070
Explain to me how lyin' helps him.
He's locked up.

1290
01:22:17,112 --> 01:22:19,567
What you sayin'?
You tryin' to pin this on me?

1291
01:22:19,614 --> 01:22:21,441
I didn't say that. You said that.

1292
01:22:21,491 --> 01:22:24,990
I asked you why you throwin' me
a line of shit. Why did you say that?

1293
01:22:25,036 --> 01:22:28,784
Oh, man.
See, you fuckin' with my words.

1294
01:22:28,831 --> 01:22:32,081
You confusin' me.
Twistin' my shits around.

1295
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:35,957
Me? Oh, who's twistin' who
here, Ronnie?

1296
01:22:36,004 --> 01:22:40,416
All's I'm askin' is why did you
try to play me like a jerk?

1297
01:22:40,466 --> 01:22:43,384
- Please, stop fuckin' with me.
- What's in it for you?

1298
01:22:43,428 --> 01:22:46,594
What the fuck is this?
20 questions or somethin'?

1299
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,556
We already spoke about this shit.

1300
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,435
Hey, Ronnie! I just want to know
what you know.

1301
01:22:52,478 --> 01:22:54,269
Am I under arrest?

1302
01:22:54,313 --> 01:22:57,931
Fuck, no! If I arrest you,
I can't talk to you.

1303
01:22:57,983 --> 01:23:00,271
Then the conversation's over.

1304
01:23:00,318 --> 01:23:03,319
Fine. You don't have to do shit.

1305
01:23:03,363 --> 01:23:05,854
But if you wanna continue
to do business here,

1306
01:23:05,907 --> 01:23:10,864
without Jo-Jo and his crew puttin'
their hands in your pockets,

1307
01:23:10,911 --> 01:23:13,533
I would think about
takin' a ride right now.

1308
01:23:13,581 --> 01:23:15,454
What the fuck I look like?

1309
01:23:15,499 --> 01:23:18,749
I ain't goin' nowhere
with your homo-cide ass.

1310
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:23,756
Look.

1311
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:26,502
Shit.

1312
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,843
Are you comin' or what?

1313
01:23:42,315 --> 01:23:44,273
How you doin'?

1314
01:23:45,986 --> 01:23:48,690
Man, you crazy, man?
I ain't goin' up in there.

1315
01:23:48,738 --> 01:23:50,695
No?

1316
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:03,951
Yo, Rocco. Yeah, yeah, come on, come
on, man. I ain't got nothin' to say.

1317
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:07,122
I was prayin'
you could help me out here.

1318
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:08,796
Because to tell you the truth,

1319
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,924
I've come completely around
to your way of thinking.

1320
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:17,210
- What's my way of thinkin'?
- I know your brother is innocent.

1321
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:20,764
If Victor was my brother
and I knew what you know,

1322
01:24:20,809 --> 01:24:24,225
every day of my life
would be a living hell.

1323
01:24:25,689 --> 01:24:28,096
You think we can do something
about this?

1324
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:30,640
- About what?
- All bullshit aside.

1325
01:24:30,694 --> 01:24:33,611
You, me, Victor, we all know
who did Darryl Adams.

1326
01:24:34,864 --> 01:24:35,979
Who?

1327
01:24:36,032 --> 01:24:38,108
Who do you think?

1328
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,317
I don't know. You tell me.

1329
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:41,532
You!

1330
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:43,488
- Me?
- You little fuck. You did it.

1331
01:24:43,539 --> 01:24:45,615
I know it, you know it!

1332
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:47,623
- Your brother knows it.
- Shit.

1333
01:24:47,668 --> 01:24:51,879
What's the thinkin' on this,
that if Victor claims self-defence,

1334
01:24:51,922 --> 01:24:54,413
he'll get off
because he has no record?

1335
01:24:54,466 --> 01:24:56,505
His life is over!

1336
01:24:56,551 --> 01:24:59,256
I know it's rough out here
for young, black males

1337
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:02,221
with racism, no jobs,
single parent families...

1338
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:04,553
- Fuck that.
- Don't fuckin' gesture at me.

1339
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,142
Have some fuckin' respect.

1340
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:09,518
But you're the fuckin' king snake!

1341
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:12,979
You're a low-down, cold-blooded,
evil junkyard nigger...

1342
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:16,274
- .. like I've never seen in my life.
- What you talkin' about?

1343
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:18,644
What'd you do, offer him money?

1344
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,733
Who the fuck are you kiddin'?
You're not the Mafia.

1345
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:25,994
You're not even Rodney Little! You're
a skinny-ass snake motherfucker.

1346
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:29,904
You think you're hot shit. You ain't
nothing but a cold, fucking fart.

1347
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:32,792
You don't know a motherfuckin' thing
about me.

1348
01:25:32,835 --> 01:25:35,456
You just a racist-ass,
nigger-hating cop.

1349
01:25:35,504 --> 01:25:37,876
You don't know how it is
for brothers.

1350
01:25:37,923 --> 01:25:39,999
And you motherfuckin' definitely...

1351
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:43,050
- Don't point...
- .. nothin' about what's goin' on.

1352
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:45,585
Don't you fuckin' point
your finger at me.

1353
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:48,307
What's goin' on? What don't I see?

1354
01:25:48,349 --> 01:25:51,303
I ain't tellin' you shit
till I see my lawyer.

1355
01:25:51,352 --> 01:25:52,810
Listen. I talked to...

1356
01:25:52,853 --> 01:25:54,976
Look at me.
I got something nice to say.

1357
01:25:55,022 --> 01:25:59,233
I talked to all your brother's
people. He's one of the decent ones.

1358
01:25:59,276 --> 01:26:03,487
Probably in his deluded decency,
he thinks he's doing a noble thing.

1359
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:07,693
But you and Victor playin' me
for a patsy? Usin' me?

1360
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:09,366
Back up with that shit.

1361
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:12,660
I read you like a Marvel fuckin'
Spiderman comic book!

1362
01:26:12,705 --> 01:26:15,955
I been inside your bald pea brain
since you were born.

1363
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,372
20 fuckin' years!

1364
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:20,707
You don't play me, I play you!

1365
01:26:23,298 --> 01:26:25,172
Fuck!

1366
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:30,094
Rocco, you can't do this
in front of our house.

1367
01:26:30,138 --> 01:26:32,177
Understand? It's no good.

1368
01:26:32,223 --> 01:26:36,224
Strike.

1369
01:26:38,938 --> 01:26:42,686
You want to make yourself crazy
goin' after someone else on this?

1370
01:26:42,733 --> 01:26:44,974
There's your man, right over there.

1371
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:47,149
Hold on.

1372
01:26:48,071 --> 01:26:51,155
Man, get your little ass in the car.

1373
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:54,781
Fuck Rodney. Yo thinks
he's gonna okey-doke me.

1374
01:26:54,827 --> 01:26:58,077
He's goin' down, Larry.
Down for the fuckin' count.

1375
01:26:58,122 --> 01:26:59,367
Take it easy.

1376
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:02,618
- How ya doin'?
- Fuck you, too, Rodney.

1377
01:27:04,253 --> 01:27:08,582
- Come on. Hey! Take it easy.
- I'm gonna cripple that cocksucker.

1378
01:27:08,632 --> 01:27:10,256
I swear on my mother's grave,
I'm gonna cripple him.

1379
01:27:12,969 --> 01:27:14,712
You were supposed to be
at my spot an hour ago.

1380
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:18,807
What am I supposed to do?
Tell Homicide I can't talk now?

1381
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:22,349
I gotta go bag up some ounces
for my boss, Rodney Little?

1382
01:27:22,394 --> 01:27:24,968
- He arrest you?
- Nah.

1383
01:27:25,022 --> 01:27:27,857
Why didn't you tell him
to go fuck hisself?

1384
01:27:30,068 --> 01:27:32,144
Well, what did he want?

1385
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:35,564
Nothin' much.
You know, same old, same old.

1386
01:27:36,282 --> 01:27:39,200
- He ask about me?
- Nah.

1387
01:27:40,286 --> 01:27:43,571
- Huh?
- Nah. Damn.

1388
01:27:43,622 --> 01:27:47,122
Cos I never said nothin' to you
about shootin' nobody.

1389
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:50,702
All's I said, you want Darryl's spot,
you got to get it for yourself.

1390
01:27:50,754 --> 01:27:54,123
- Shit, I didn't even say that.
- Fuck you, Rodney.

1391
01:28:00,013 --> 01:28:04,591
Excuse me. Who the fuck are you
talkin' to like that?

1392
01:28:04,642 --> 01:28:07,429
You outta your motherfuckin'
mind, hmm?

1393
01:28:08,062 --> 01:28:12,640
You think I'm one of them little crew
niggers sittin' on a project bench?

1394
01:28:13,609 --> 01:28:16,977
Open your mouth, nigger.
You feel that?

1395
01:28:17,863 --> 01:28:21,231
I put this gun in your bad breath
smellin' mouth,

1396
01:28:21,282 --> 01:28:22,942
I will pull the trigger.

1397
01:28:22,992 --> 01:28:25,566
I'll splatter
what little brains you got

1398
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:28,870
all over the Corinthian
leather interior of my car.

1399
01:28:28,914 --> 01:28:32,366
This is my wife's brand-new car,
so you know I don't give a fuck.

1400
01:28:32,418 --> 01:28:34,457
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1401
01:28:34,503 --> 01:28:38,168
- Do you understand me, bitch?
- Yeah!

1402
01:28:38,215 --> 01:28:40,254
Let me tell you somethin' else.

1403
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:45,678
If I ever hear about you talkin' to
that Homicide one more time,

1404
01:28:45,722 --> 01:28:49,173
that Rocco, I don't care
if he asks you the time of day,

1405
01:28:49,225 --> 01:28:51,182
if I hear about my name comin' up,

1406
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:54,678
I'm gonna know it was you
and I'm gonna kill ya.

1407
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:58,395
I mean, you are 1-87
on the street, understand?

1408
01:28:58,442 --> 01:29:01,561
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

1409
01:29:01,611 --> 01:29:03,687
Word is bond.

1410
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:07,688
Now get your motherfuckin'
ass outta my car.

1411
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,865
Who bought you this shit?

1412
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:12,402
Strike bought you that shit?

1413
01:29:12,455 --> 01:29:15,159
Where your mama at?
She know you out here?

1414
01:29:15,207 --> 01:29:16,452
When I was a little boy,

1415
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,454
my daddy would have kicked my butt
all over this street.

1416
01:29:19,503 --> 01:29:22,504
- I don't have a father, all right?
- You got one now.

1417
01:29:22,547 --> 01:29:25,382
When Errol is talkin' to you,
you listen.

1418
01:29:25,425 --> 01:29:28,841
- You're not my daddy.
- I'm your daddy now.

1419
01:29:28,887 --> 01:29:30,132
You get your butt...

1420
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,801
You little motherfuckers,
get outta here!

1421
01:29:32,849 --> 01:29:35,933
Hey, look here.
Now I got to deal with this.

1422
01:29:35,977 --> 01:29:38,052
Look at this.

1423
01:29:38,104 --> 01:29:39,977
Shit.

1424
01:29:40,022 --> 01:29:42,513
What the fuck is he doin'?

1425
01:29:45,444 --> 01:29:48,231
I'm a bad man.
Errol!

1426
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,356
Get your hand off me.

1427
01:29:52,242 --> 01:29:56,619
- What are you doin', man?
- Get the fuck outta here.

1428
01:29:56,662 --> 01:29:58,572
Errol, come here.

1429
01:30:04,086 --> 01:30:06,078
Step off.

1430
01:30:17,849 --> 01:30:21,467
Hey, Shorty.
Now, fun and games is over.

1431
01:30:21,519 --> 01:30:24,092
I warned your ass
about Errol, didn't I?

1432
01:30:24,146 --> 01:30:27,017
- Huh? Didn't I?
- What's goin' on here?

1433
01:30:27,066 --> 01:30:29,853
I don't want to see your ass
hangin' around me no more.

1434
01:30:29,902 --> 01:30:32,190
- What'd I do?
- Now take your ass home.

1435
01:30:32,237 --> 01:30:34,609
I don't want to see
your ass no more!

1436
01:30:34,656 --> 01:30:37,491
You a little nigger.
This is real nigger shit.

1437
01:30:37,534 --> 01:30:40,653
You need to be in school.
Get your ass up...

1438
01:30:40,703 --> 01:30:43,075
- I thought I was def!
- Shut the fuck up!

1439
01:30:43,122 --> 01:30:45,198
Take your ass home to your moms.

1440
01:30:45,249 --> 01:30:48,582
Get the fuck up them steps.
Hurry up, man!

1441
01:30:50,045 --> 01:30:54,043
- Hurry the fuck up!
- Shouldn't have taught me then.

1442
01:30:55,092 --> 01:30:56,751
Punk.

1443
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:05,639
I busted these
four yuppie dickheads over at Ahab's.

1444
01:31:05,685 --> 01:31:08,092
They drove down
in Daddy's Benz to cop.

1445
01:31:08,145 --> 01:31:09,853
So fuckin' what?

1446
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:13,432
I'm gonna use them to pinch that
motherfucking shinehead Rodney.

1447
01:31:13,484 --> 01:31:15,772
I got 'im set up.

1448
01:31:16,612 --> 01:31:18,485
You got Rodney set up?

1449
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:21,400
Got that fuckin' yo
set up just like the movie.

1450
01:31:24,202 --> 01:31:26,278
Let me do a favour for ya.

1451
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:29,164
Me and Mazilli know the prick.
Let us pick him up.

1452
01:31:29,207 --> 01:31:30,749
You'd owe me two favours.

1453
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:33,911
You ain't gonna let me forget.
I ain't worried.

1454
01:31:33,961 --> 01:31:36,452
No, I won't.

1455
01:31:41,259 --> 01:31:46,217
I wash my face in dirty water

1456
01:31:49,642 --> 01:31:54,980
Cos it gives my mind a little order

1457
01:31:58,233 --> 01:32:03,144
And I play that game
just like I should do

1458
01:32:05,323 --> 01:32:11,278
But my whole world slips away

1459
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:20,165
I live my life, I live it slowly

1460
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:28,049
And I take my time, I'm in no hurry

1461
01:32:28,094 --> 01:32:30,881
Yeah, I'm livin'

1462
01:32:31,806 --> 01:32:36,349
And when I go
then I would surely...

1463
01:32:39,355 --> 01:32:42,024
Hey, Mr Mazilli.

1464
01:32:43,651 --> 01:32:46,402
Klein. What you need, man?

1465
01:32:46,445 --> 01:32:49,730
- I need you, brother.
- Oh, yeah?

1466
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:53,316
- For what?
- I got me a warrant on ya.

1467
01:32:53,368 --> 01:32:56,322
- Warrant for what?
- Arrest.

1468
01:32:57,413 --> 01:33:00,912
You want to arrest me?
For what, Mazilli?

1469
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:03,531
You must have sold
to an undercover, man.

1470
01:33:03,586 --> 01:33:04,914
Oh, man, please!

1471
01:33:04,962 --> 01:33:07,583
You so desperate
you sellin' shit yourself?

1472
01:33:07,631 --> 01:33:09,090
Excuse me.

1473
01:33:09,132 --> 01:33:11,090
All right.

1474
01:33:11,134 --> 01:33:14,052
- Who tryin' to set me up?
- What do I know?

1475
01:33:14,095 --> 01:33:17,630
- Come on, man.
- I'm Homicide, man.

1476
01:33:17,682 --> 01:33:21,810
How long we been
doin' business, huh?

1477
01:33:21,853 --> 01:33:24,972
All of a sudden
it don't count for nothin'?

1478
01:33:25,022 --> 01:33:28,272
All I know is, somebody says
Rodney's your buddy.

1479
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:32,065
He's not gonna break balls
if you go in. So?

1480
01:33:32,112 --> 01:33:33,772
Right, Rodney?

1481
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:38,399
Rocco Klein, Rocco Klein.
I always wanted to ask you.

1482
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:42,780
You Italian, you a Jew? What are you?
You can't make up your mind?

1483
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:44,490
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

1484

I'm from the lost Black Tribe
of Israel, the Yos.

1485
01:33:48,377 --> 01:33:52,125

get your shit, and let's go.

I'm tryin' to make a dollar.

1487
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:00,925
- Yeah, I'm proud of ya. Let's go.
- We got a job, too, OK?

1488
01:34:01,848 --> 01:34:03,840
Skyler, go find Errol.

1489
01:34:03,892 --> 01:34:06,465
Tell him to come down
and mind the store for me.

1490
01:34:06,519 --> 01:34:09,224
Tell my wife to get
my bail money together, too.

1491
01:34:09,272 --> 01:34:12,023
Give Errol my best, all right?

1492

01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,551
'We will make our point-by-point
analysis of actual... '

1512
01:35:47,988 --> 01:35:51,072
God damn, man! Who stole my gat?

1513
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:36,771
- Who set me up, Mazilli?
- Ho-ho.

1514
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:39,991
Yeah, you better not tell me.

1515
01:36:40,036 --> 01:36:43,120
Save my ass from a homicide charge.

1516
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:47,493
Don't tell us before, man.
We like to figure these things out.

1517
01:36:47,543 --> 01:36:51,493
Takes all the fun out
of the investigation.

1518
01:36:56,635 --> 01:36:59,208
On the real side, who served me up?

1519
01:36:59,262 --> 01:37:02,299
What do I look like?
One of your hos?

1520
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:06,008
Yo, genius. Who do you think?

1521
01:37:07,812 --> 01:37:12,224
He's in a jam. It must've been
the chocolate Moos.

1522
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:21,775
Get the ball.
Yeah, get it. Good.

1523
01:37:29,624 --> 01:37:33,408
Got it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1524
01:37:33,461 --> 01:37:35,702
- Good, good, good!
- Yo, Sharon!

1525
01:37:37,339 --> 01:37:39,166
Hi, Uncle Ronnie.

1526
01:37:39,216 --> 01:37:41,754
- Yo, what's up, Mark? Chillin'?
- Yeah.

1527
01:37:41,802 --> 01:37:43,925
All right.

1528
01:37:46,807 --> 01:37:50,306
So, how Victor doing? What's going on
with that bail situation?

1529
01:37:50,351 --> 01:37:52,474
- Down to $5,000.
- Word.

1530
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:56,767
Good. Good. It's about fuckin' time.
Check this out.

1531
01:37:58,234 --> 01:38:00,522
Strike, somebody's gonna see you.

1532
01:38:02,237 --> 01:38:04,775
Put that away. Hurry up.

1533
01:38:07,451 --> 01:38:10,155
That's $5,000 right there,
all right?

1534
01:38:10,203 --> 01:38:13,987
Give that to Mommy. Tell her
to get her son up out of jail.

1535
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:17,243
Don't tell her I gave it
to you, all right?

1536
01:38:17,293 --> 01:38:19,369
You goin' somewhere?

1537
01:38:21,422 --> 01:38:23,498
I might, but I don't know.

1538
01:38:23,549 --> 01:38:27,381
Ronald, you need
to talk to your mother.

1539
01:38:30,055 --> 01:38:33,506
- You listenin'?
- Yeah, I hear you.

1540
01:38:36,186 --> 01:38:38,474
Thanks.

1541
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:40,810
- All right.
- Later.

1542
01:38:40,857 --> 01:38:45,649
OK, let's go. The Dunham brothers
are up, and he catches it. Yes!

1543
01:39:01,334 --> 01:39:04,335
- Yo, Scientific?
- What's up, B? What's up?

1544
01:39:04,378 --> 01:39:06,537
What you guys
just sitting around for?

1545
01:39:06,589 --> 01:39:10,040
What the fuck you yellin' at?
That nigger Rodney got locked up.

1546
01:39:10,092 --> 01:39:12,049
- For what?
- You don't know why?

1547
01:39:12,094 --> 01:39:14,798
- No, I don't.
- Strike!

1548
01:39:14,846 --> 01:39:16,389
You know.

1549
01:39:16,431 --> 01:39:18,803
- Yo, Strike! Yo, Strike!
- Y'all hold on.

1550
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:20,807
Yo, Shorty. Get out of here, man!

1551
01:39:20,852 --> 01:39:23,972
I gotta talk to you.
I said I gotta talk to you!

1552
01:39:24,022 --> 01:39:25,931
- Get out of here!
- Hey, Ronnie.

1553
01:39:25,982 --> 01:39:28,223
- Stop iggin' me!
- Ah, fuck!

1554
01:39:28,276 --> 01:39:30,482
Put it here, pal.

1555
01:39:30,528 --> 01:39:33,018
Let me talk to you for a minute.

1556
01:39:33,072 --> 01:39:35,111
So you wanna fuck with me?

1557
01:39:35,157 --> 01:39:38,027
Let me show you
what fuckin's all about.

1558
01:39:38,076 --> 01:39:40,614
What the fuck
you talkin' about, man?

1559
01:39:40,662 --> 01:39:44,245
Your man is in the joint.
I just came by to thank you.

1560
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:47,659
Yo! Yo, fuck you, Rocco.
You can't pin this shit on me!

1561
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:51,328
Oh, no? All I know is that
Rodney makes bail tomorrow.

1562
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:53,124
He'll be back out on the street.

1563
01:39:53,174 --> 01:39:55,664
What do you think your homies
will tell him?

1564
01:39:55,718 --> 01:40:00,628
If I was you, I'd fly down to the
DA's office, get my ass protected.

1565
01:40:00,681 --> 01:40:04,630
I don't even be fuckin' around
no more. I don't be hustlin'.

1566
01:40:04,684 --> 01:40:06,558
Ronald, do yourself a favour.

1567
01:40:06,603 --> 01:40:08,595
Tell me what really happened.

1568
01:40:08,646 --> 01:40:11,896
How your boss Rodney
pressured you into doing Darryl.

1569
01:40:11,941 --> 01:40:15,191
I tell you, that nigger
set Rodney up, man. I know it.

1570
01:40:15,236 --> 01:40:20,312
Nobody wants you on this. You had
no choice. Rodney had you scared.

1571
01:40:20,366 --> 01:40:22,025
Kill or be killed, right?

1572
01:40:22,075 --> 01:40:25,160
You don't even know
what the fuck you talkin' about.

1573
01:40:25,203 --> 01:40:27,445
You just got me killed
on some dumb shit.

1574
01:40:27,497 --> 01:40:30,617
Black man say he didn't do somethin',
you don't believe him.

1575
01:40:30,667 --> 01:40:33,584
Say he did do something,
you still don't believe him.

1576
01:40:33,628 --> 01:40:35,122
Have a good life.

1577
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:38,289
Oh, fuck!

1578
01:40:40,342 --> 01:40:44,803
Yo, y'all. I know you niggers
know I wouldn't diss Rodney.

1579
01:40:44,847 --> 01:40:46,756
Homo-cide is buggin'. Word up.

1580
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:51,184
Word to Allah, man. You a
motherfuckin' punk ass lyin' bitch!

1581
01:40:52,729 --> 01:40:54,805
Fuck you! I'll fuck you up!

1582
01:40:55,523 --> 01:40:56,721
You a fuckin' snitch!

1583
01:40:56,774 --> 01:41:00,225
That nigger snitched on Rodney!
And you punch like a bitch!

1584
01:41:43,776 --> 01:41:45,567
Your mama's in her bed.

1585
01:41:45,611 --> 01:41:47,900
Well, I ain't gonna wake her.

1586
01:41:47,947 --> 01:41:50,069
You don't get it, do you?

1587
01:41:50,115 --> 01:41:52,737
- Yo.
- 'Errol. '

1588
01:41:52,784 --> 01:41:53,947
Yo.

1589
01:41:56,413 --> 01:42:00,197
- I'm in the lockup.
- Lockup? For what?

1590
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:02,408
I don't know.

1591
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:05,580
I'm still trying
to figure it out myself.

1592
01:42:07,381 --> 01:42:09,588
'But I know who put me here.

1593
01:42:10,676 --> 01:42:14,045
'That little... punk ass Strike. '

1594
01:42:14,096 --> 01:42:16,931
'Strike?'

1595
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:20,973
'You know what you gotta do, right?'

1596
01:42:21,019 --> 01:42:24,803
- 'It's done. '
- 'I'll see you tomorrow. '

1597
01:42:25,899 --> 01:42:28,354
Yo.

1598
01:42:37,117 --> 01:42:40,153
- You still around here, nigger?
- What you think?

1599
01:42:40,203 --> 01:42:43,074
All right. I guess
Errol ain't find your ass yet.

1600
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:46,289
- Errol?. What he want?
- Yo, Strike!

1601
01:42:48,545 --> 01:42:51,878
- What he want, stupid?
- How the fuck I'm 'posed to know?

1602
01:42:51,923 --> 01:42:55,706
Maybe he wanna play
with your fuckin' train set

1603
01:42:57,761 --> 01:43:02,304
- Man, fuck you.
- Fuck you, nigger! I mean, snitch.

1604
01:43:02,349 --> 01:43:03,760
Shit.

1605
01:43:03,809 --> 01:43:07,936
Yo, Shorty, how many...
How many times I gotta tell you, man?

1606
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:09,687
Stop sweatin' me. You a kid.

1607
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:12,566
This is grown-up stuff.
You gonna get hurt out here.

1608
01:43:12,608 --> 01:43:15,728
Now, take your little bag
of candy, take your little bike

1609
01:43:15,778 --> 01:43:18,316
and go find some friends, all right?

1610
01:43:18,364 --> 01:43:20,855
Damn! Fuckin' kids, man.

1611
01:43:28,707 --> 01:43:30,533
Oh, shit!

1612
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:33,205
Boogie-Down was performing

1613
01:43:33,253 --> 01:43:35,660
Down with the sounds called VDP

1614
01:43:35,713 --> 01:43:37,373
Boogie-Down was performing

1615
01:43:39,175 --> 01:43:40,835
It ain't no joke

1616
01:43:40,885 --> 01:43:43,007
Back in the days
I knew rap would never die

1617
01:43:43,053 --> 01:43:45,971
I used to listen
to Awesome-2 on WHBI

1618
01:43:46,014 --> 01:43:47,924
I used to hear all kind
of rap groups

1619
01:43:47,975 --> 01:43:51,224
Before samplin' loops
rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits

1620
01:43:51,269 --> 01:43:52,894
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that

1621
01:43:52,938 --> 01:43:55,974
So we would go to the park
while they was jammin' to hear rap

1622
01:43:56,024 --> 01:43:58,063
I used to listen
till the cops broke it up

1623
01:43:58,109 --> 01:44:00,896
Always thought to myself
"Damn, why they fucked it up"

1624
01:44:00,945 --> 01:44:03,614
But nevertheless
I was in love with the microphone

1625
01:44:03,656 --> 01:44:06,028
And it stayed that way
until I left home

1626
01:44:06,075 --> 01:44:08,281
On the streets of New York
now I'm free

1627
01:44:08,327 --> 01:44:10,782
But with freedom
comes big responsibility

1628
01:44:10,829 --> 01:44:12,952
I used to walk around
driven by the force

1629
01:44:12,998 --> 01:44:15,998
I remember how large Super
Rhymes was when he fell off

1630
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:18,201
I used to wonder about crews
that used to rock

1631
01:44:18,253 --> 01:44:21,040
They were large but none of them
could manage to stay on top

1632
01:44:21,089 --> 01:44:22,998
Do you ever think about
when you outta here

1633
01:44:23,049 --> 01:44:25,836
Record deal and video outta here

1634
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:28,126
Mercedes-Benz
and Range Rover outta here

1635
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:30,669
No doubt BDP is old school
but we ain't goin' out...

1636
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:32,881
What you want, little...

1637
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:39,604
Yo, Ty! Ty!

1638
01:44:39,647 --> 01:44:41,889
You little motherfucker!

1639
01:44:41,941 --> 01:44:46,235
Some years went by, I signed myself
into a group home...

1640
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:48,948
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
You buggin'?

1641
01:44:50,533 --> 01:44:52,442
Shit.

1642
01:44:54,578 --> 01:44:56,487
I don't know what happened.

1643
01:44:56,538 --> 01:45:00,999
I've known this kid his whole life,
his mother, too. Good, decent people.

1644
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:04,992
Now, whatever happened out there,
it was a big mistake.

1645
01:45:05,046 --> 01:45:09,423
I mean... I mean, Tyrone's never been
in trouble before. He's like...

1646
01:45:09,467 --> 01:45:13,879
He's like, uh, 85th percentile
on the national education test.

1647
01:45:13,929 --> 01:45:18,721
I mean, uh...
Now this thing could ruin his life.

1648
01:45:18,767 --> 01:45:20,641
Please.

1649
01:45:22,354 --> 01:45:25,520
Just help him with his moms
and his statement.

1650
01:45:25,607 --> 01:45:27,895
You know what I'm askin'.

1651
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:43,529
Does my son have to go to jail?.

1652
01:45:48,586 --> 01:45:50,994
Would you permit me to talk to him?

1653
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:59,677
If you talk to him, does he still
have to go to jail?.

1654
01:46:01,557 --> 01:46:05,175
Tyrone, you know
what you did, don't you?

1655
01:46:05,227 --> 01:46:08,642
- Yeah.
- You know it was wrong?

1656
01:46:11,816 --> 01:46:15,861
- He knows.
- OK. We got that outta the way.

1657
01:46:16,988 --> 01:46:19,064
You did wrong.

1658
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:24,651
But you were scared, right?
You couldn't help it.

1659
01:46:24,703 --> 01:46:26,779
My son was terrified.

1660
01:46:30,125 --> 01:46:35,546
Tyrone, you're a good kid, but it's
tough growin' up in the projects.

1661
01:46:35,588 --> 01:46:40,629
Drugs, crime, peer pressure. You know
what that means, peer pressure?

1662
01:46:40,676 --> 01:46:44,508
- Yes.
- I hear you're real intelligent.

1663
01:46:46,849 --> 01:46:49,174
Don't your friends make fun of you

1664
01:46:49,226 --> 01:46:52,476
when you get straight As,
speak correct English,

1665
01:46:52,521 --> 01:46:55,936
attend school,
go to classes, don't hang out?

1666
01:46:55,982 --> 01:46:58,188
Don't they call you white boy?

1667
01:46:58,234 --> 01:47:02,314
Don't they call you soft because
you ain't hanging with them hard?

1668
01:47:03,364 --> 01:47:07,575
I know they do, but all you
want to do is the right thing.

1669
01:47:07,618 --> 01:47:11,318
But they keep threatening you,
threatening your mother.

1670
01:47:12,456 --> 01:47:14,662
Tyrone.

1671
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:17,709
So you get a gat.
So you, too, can be hard-core.

1672
01:47:17,752 --> 01:47:20,706
Protect yourself and your mother.

1673
01:47:20,755 --> 01:47:24,503
- Do you know the man you shot?
- Yeah.

1674
01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:27,717
That was Errol Barnes,
a stone killer.

1675
01:47:27,762 --> 01:47:31,510
He did time
for killin' a kid your age.

1676
01:47:31,557 --> 01:47:34,593
Here you are, riding your bike,
minding your own business.

1677
01:47:34,643 --> 01:47:36,386
You have a gun for protection.

1678
01:47:36,436 --> 01:47:39,010
All of a sudden,
there's Errol, that kid killer,

1679
01:47:39,064 --> 01:47:41,389
standing right in front of you.

1680
01:47:41,441 --> 01:47:44,014
He's got this horrible look
in his beady eyes.

1681
01:47:44,068 --> 01:47:45,895
You see him reaching...

1682
01:47:45,945 --> 01:47:48,483
Tyrone, look at me.
Look at me, Tyrone.

1683
01:47:48,531 --> 01:47:51,982
You see him reaching for that.38
stuck in his waist.

1684
01:47:52,034 --> 01:47:56,447
You know he's gonna gat you.
Then who's gonna protect your mother?

1685
01:47:57,623 --> 01:48:02,000
You never fired that gun before, but
Errol was about to pull that trigger.

1686
01:48:02,043 --> 01:48:04,451
You're scared.

1687
01:48:04,504 --> 01:48:07,873
All you wanna do is ride your bike.
It's either him or you.

1688
01:48:07,924 --> 01:48:11,756
But this killer in front of you.
There's no time to think,

1689
01:48:11,802 --> 01:48:13,961
his finger is on the trigger.

1690
01:48:15,014 --> 01:48:18,881
Boom, boom. The gun just appeared
in your hand.

1691
01:48:18,934 --> 01:48:21,092
That's what happened.

1692
01:48:23,772 --> 01:48:25,930
That's what exactly happened.

1693
01:48:25,982 --> 01:48:29,814
And when I ask you what happened
with the tape recorder on,

1694
01:48:29,861 --> 01:48:34,855
that's exactly what
you're going to tell me, right?

1695
01:48:34,907 --> 01:48:37,943
Because you always tell the truth.

1696
01:48:39,411 --> 01:48:41,368
Now, one last thing.

1697
01:48:41,413 --> 01:48:46,205
We need to know - again, tell
the truth - where'd you get the gat?

1698
01:48:47,752 --> 01:48:50,670
- I found it.
- Where'd you find it?

1699
01:48:50,714 --> 01:48:53,880
- In the bushes.
- Where in the bushes?

1700
01:48:55,968 --> 01:48:59,836
I'm not turning it on yet.
Where in the bushes?

1701
01:48:59,889 --> 01:49:04,016
- What bushes?
- The bushes near my building.

1702
01:49:04,059 --> 01:49:07,309
Tyrone, you gotta help me out here.

1703
01:49:07,354 --> 01:49:09,263
And your mama.

1704
01:49:11,733 --> 01:49:13,809
The truth.

1705
01:49:16,404 --> 01:49:19,773
OK. I borrowed it by accident.

1706
01:49:19,824 --> 01:49:24,402
From who? Remember,
you always tell the truth.

1707
01:49:24,453 --> 01:49:27,026
I borrowed it by accident
from Strike.

1708
01:49:27,081 --> 01:49:28,872
Strike?

1709
01:49:28,916 --> 01:49:30,789
Motherfucker!

1710
01:49:36,965 --> 01:49:39,965
All right, son. All right.
You did the right thing.

1711
01:49:40,009 --> 01:49:44,470
I was tryin' to give it back to him,
but he doesn't speak to me any more.

1712
01:49:44,513 --> 01:49:48,760
I keep trying...
but he keeps iggin' me.

1713
01:49:48,809 --> 01:49:50,848
All right, son.

1714
01:49:52,104 --> 01:49:54,559
I'm gonna put the recorder on now.

1715
01:49:54,606 --> 01:49:57,891
You state your name,
and you tell the story, relax,

1716
01:49:57,942 --> 01:50:00,018
just the way you told it to me.

1717
01:50:04,615 --> 01:50:06,026
- Your name?
- Tyrone Jeeter.

1718
01:50:08,994 --> 01:50:11,070
Oh, shit.

1719
01:50:11,121 --> 01:50:14,537
Fuck that nigger up, man!
What the fuck you doing?

1720
01:50:14,583 --> 01:50:17,833
You ruined that boy's life,
you fuckin' parasite!

1721
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:20,084
I had nothin'
to do with that shit!

1722
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:22,003
I'm tired of excuses!

1723
01:50:22,841 --> 01:50:24,121
Tired of excuses.

1724
01:50:24,175 --> 01:50:26,927
- 'Mommy!'
- You know nothin'!

1725
01:50:26,969 --> 01:50:29,840
"It's not my fault. "
I'm not hearin' that shit!

1726
01:50:29,889 --> 01:50:32,640
It's motherfuckers like you
mugged Rosa Parks.

1727
01:50:32,683 --> 01:50:35,803
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?!

1728
01:50:35,853 --> 01:50:39,802
- It's hard on the brothers.
- You stupid, ignorant motherfucker!

1729
01:50:39,856 --> 01:50:44,435
Brothers?! Brothers! Is this the way
you take care of your brothers, huh?

1730
01:50:44,486 --> 01:50:48,863
Real brothers take responsibility.
I'm gonna make damn sure you do.

1731
01:50:48,906 --> 01:50:51,943
I won't be fuckin' around.
I'm done with that.

1732
01:50:51,993 --> 01:50:53,819
Done with it? Done with that?

1733
01:50:53,869 --> 01:50:56,574
You bet you are.
You are done from these streets.

1734
01:50:56,622 --> 01:50:59,991
You're gone from this project,
and you're gone from New York.

1735
01:51:00,042 --> 01:51:01,951
You hear me?

1736
01:51:02,002 --> 01:51:03,911
Oh, shit!

1737
01:51:04,838 --> 01:51:07,163
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1738
01:51:07,215 --> 01:51:10,382
Yo, why don't you stomp
that nigger too, man?

1739
01:51:10,426 --> 01:51:12,964
- Come on, man.
- Get back! Get back!

1740
01:51:13,012 --> 01:51:15,550
- Gonna shoot everybody?
- Get the fuck back!

1741
01:51:15,598 --> 01:51:17,756
Come on! You want somethin'?

1742
01:51:17,808 --> 01:51:20,928
You got it, man! You got it! What?

1743
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:23,679
Get up.

1744
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:26,019
Get up, get up, get up!

1745
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:35,364
If I ever see you again,
I'm going to kill you!

1746
01:51:35,408 --> 01:51:38,278
I'm gonna shoot you in your dome,
put a gun in your hand

1747
01:51:38,327 --> 01:51:42,870
and say you tried to raise up on me
for this beat down you just got.

1748
01:51:44,625 --> 01:51:47,116
Do you understand? Do you understand?

1749
01:51:50,005 --> 01:51:51,878
Shit!

1750
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:12,607
He wants to fly
but his wings won't let him go

1751
01:52:12,651 --> 01:52:17,312
He wants to travel
but don't wanna go so low

1752
01:52:17,363 --> 01:52:20,364
Oh-oh, Daddy, when I grow up

1753
01:52:20,408 --> 01:52:22,650
I want to be a silent hero...

1754
01:52:22,702 --> 01:52:26,533
Ah, look who's here!
I was just comin' to get you.

1755
01:52:27,748 --> 01:52:29,657
Rodney or Andre?

1756
01:52:33,879 --> 01:52:37,082
Rodney! Take a number, you're next!

1757
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,420
What'd you think
you was gonna do? Become president?

1758
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:45,755
Yo, man! Why did Tyrone
do that stupid shit for?

1759
01:52:45,806 --> 01:52:48,973
The boy did it for you.
He was protecting you.

1760
01:52:49,018 --> 01:52:51,805
Rodney ain't no fool.
He sent Errol after you,

1761
01:52:51,854 --> 01:52:54,641
and this poor fuckin' kid
stepped into the breach.

1762
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:56,184
David and Goliath.

1763
01:52:56,233 --> 01:53:00,064
Now he's a 12-year-old murderer.
Way to go, Strike.

1764
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:02,234
Yo, don't lay that on me, all right?

1765
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:03,691
Don't lay that on you?

1766
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:08,448
- I had nothin' to do with Tyrone.
- You had nothin' to do with it?

1767
01:53:08,494 --> 01:53:11,614
Can you look yourself
in the fuckin' mirror and tell me

1768
01:53:11,664 --> 01:53:13,621
you had nothin' to do with Tyrone?

1769
01:53:13,666 --> 01:53:16,073
Why the fuck you have to come
shake my hand anyway?

1770
01:53:16,126 --> 01:53:19,826
Didn't I tell you not to play me?
Did I not tell you that?

1771
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:23,711
I don't give a fuck what you said!
You can't put this weight on me!

1772
01:53:23,758 --> 01:53:26,629
Nah, why should you carry
the fuckin' weight?

1773
01:53:26,678 --> 01:53:29,050
You must be a wonderful
fuckin' guy,

1774
01:53:29,097 --> 01:53:31,931
everybody tryin' to protect you
- Tyrone, Victor.

1775
01:53:31,974 --> 01:53:35,722
You know what? They all went down
protecting you from the same guy,

1776
01:53:35,769 --> 01:53:37,643
and he's still out there.

1777
01:53:37,688 --> 01:53:40,060
I'm the only one
that can protect you now.

1778
01:53:40,107 --> 01:53:42,645
That's right. Me. Me.

1779
01:53:42,692 --> 01:53:46,144
So you tell me how Rodney
pressured you into cappin'...

1780
01:53:46,196 --> 01:53:47,358
Oh, man!

1781
01:53:47,405 --> 01:53:50,322
.. Darryl Adams,
and we'll drop him down a hole.

1782
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,569
Don't tell me Rodney
pulled the trigger if he didn't.

1783
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:57,621
All's you gotta do now
is tell me the truth.

1784
01:53:57,665 --> 01:53:59,373
Did you shoot Darryl Adams?

1785
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:04,876
No, man, no. Damn.

1786
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:07,329
- Who did?
- Scientific.

1787
01:54:10,885 --> 01:54:14,301
- Who the fuck is Scientific?
- He's with my crew.

1788
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:16,719
- Did you see him kill Darryl Adams?
- No.

1789
01:54:16,766 --> 01:54:18,972
- Did he tell you he killed Darryl?.
- No!

1790
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:22,137
- Did he tell anybody?
- I don't know! Why you sweatin' me?

1791
01:54:22,187 --> 01:54:23,765
It was Errol Barnes!

1792
01:54:25,023 --> 01:54:28,107
Get up!
Get up, you fuckin' lyin' cocksucker!

1793
01:54:28,151 --> 01:54:29,526
You crazy?

1794
01:54:29,569 --> 01:54:32,985
I'm gonna hand-feed you
to fuckin' Rodney myself!

1795
01:54:33,031 --> 01:54:35,782
I swear to God!
It was a nigger named My Man.

1796
01:54:35,825 --> 01:54:37,948
My brother said My Man would do it.

1797
01:54:37,994 --> 01:54:41,160
- My Man?
- I didn't have the heart to do him!

1798
01:54:41,205 --> 01:54:44,656
- I didn't have the heart to do 'im!
- Victor said My Man would do it.

1799
01:54:44,708 --> 01:54:47,329
We was in Kool Breeze and shit,
a- a-and Victor,

1800
01:54:47,377 --> 01:54:49,951
he just told me,
he was like, he said, "My Man".

1801
01:54:50,005 --> 01:54:53,208
Maybe Victor was so drunk
he did tell My Man to do it.

1802
01:54:53,258 --> 01:54:55,749
Bullshit, bullshit!
Let's go see Rodney.

1803
01:54:55,802 --> 01:54:56,964
Rocco.

1804
01:54:57,011 --> 01:55:00,345
If you don't get your hand
off my son, you better...

1805
01:55:00,389 --> 01:55:04,601
- Victor called me from the bar.
- You ain't gotta tell him nothin'.

1806
01:55:04,643 --> 01:55:06,387
Victor called me from the bar.

1807
01:55:08,063 --> 01:55:11,432
Mom? I think I'm gonna
do somethin' bad.

1808
01:55:12,484 --> 01:55:14,975
Ma, I can feel it.

1809
01:55:15,028 --> 01:55:17,982
Look, I'm just tired, that's all.

1810
01:55:18,031 --> 01:55:20,272
I'm just sick and tired.

1811
01:55:22,326 --> 01:55:26,406
And somebody's gotta pay.
Somebody's gotta pay.

1812
01:55:26,455 --> 01:55:29,160
He came back into the house
an hour later.

1813
01:55:34,046 --> 01:55:36,881
Victor! Baby, what's wrong?

1814
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:42,837
Oh, Mama, I shot somebody!

1815
01:55:42,887 --> 01:55:45,674
I shot somebody.

1816
01:55:47,892 --> 01:55:49,552
'He was throwin' up all night.

1817
01:55:49,602 --> 01:55:53,136
'I didn't even know that other boy
was lyin' dead in the parking lot. '

1818
01:55:53,188 --> 01:55:57,020
The next morning... he says
that he can't get out of bed -

1819
01:55:57,067 --> 01:55:59,522
his legs are cramped, he can't walk.

1820
01:55:59,569 --> 01:56:02,060
Mama, let me tell you,
it was just like a dream,

1821
01:56:02,113 --> 01:56:05,447
like somebody else
was pullin' the trigger, you know?

1822
01:56:13,707 --> 01:56:15,949
And that's what happened.

1823
01:56:16,001 --> 01:56:18,326
Mommy, I swear,
I'm gonna help Victor.

1824
01:56:18,378 --> 01:56:20,371
What is going to happen to my son?

1825
01:56:20,422 --> 01:56:22,794
Did you get the money from Sharon?

1826
01:56:22,841 --> 01:56:25,545
- Huh? For the bail?.
- She wouldn't take it.

1827
01:56:38,606 --> 01:56:41,275
My son Victor...

1828
01:56:41,316 --> 01:56:43,807
said it was self-defence.

1829
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:45,734
Believe him!

1830
01:57:28,735 --> 01:57:30,443
Shit!

1831
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:34,734
Shit.

1832
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:42,618
"Bitch... you is dead. "

1833
01:57:45,751 --> 01:57:49,334
Motherfucker
stole my bags, too.

1834
01:57:49,379 --> 01:57:53,875
Yo, Strike. Your boy Rodney
took a piss in your car.

1835
01:58:01,099 --> 01:58:03,424
So, where do you want
to live, Ronnie?

1836
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:06,726
I don't know, man.
You tell me.

1837
01:58:08,397 --> 01:58:11,932
We's goin' to the Port Authority
Bus Terminal.

1838
01:58:12,818 --> 01:58:15,984
Please, Rocco, man,
take me to Penn Station.

1839
01:58:16,947 --> 01:58:18,654
Same difference.

1840
01:58:34,713 --> 01:58:37,002
'Self-defence. Self-defence.

1841
01:58:38,467 --> 01:58:41,716
'Victor is pleading self-defence. '

1842
01:58:41,761 --> 01:58:45,462
So, what's up with Tyrone?
Does he get bail?.

1843
01:58:48,309 --> 01:58:50,634
No bail on juveniles.

1844
01:58:50,686 --> 01:58:53,936
His mother has him until the trial.

1845
01:58:53,981 --> 01:58:56,898
So, how much time is he gonna get?

1846
01:58:59,736 --> 01:59:03,485
Maybe a half-year
in a youth house, if he's lucky.

1847
01:59:03,531 --> 01:59:09,118
Yo, Rocco, before I get out, man,
just answer me this one question.

1848
01:59:09,162 --> 01:59:11,866
Why was you so gung-ho
about all this shit, man?

1849
01:59:11,914 --> 01:59:13,492
Most cops...

1850
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:17,455
Brothers killin' other brothers
ain't no big thing. Blasé, blasé.

1851
01:59:17,503 --> 01:59:22,793
What made you care about me, my
brother Victor, Darryl Adams, Tyrone?

1852
01:59:22,841 --> 01:59:25,248
Huh? What made you give a shit?

1853
01:59:31,057 --> 01:59:34,177
If I ever see you again,

1854
01:59:34,227 --> 01:59:38,520
I'll book you on charges
of criminal solicitation

1855
01:59:38,564 --> 01:59:41,434
and conspiracy to commit murder.

1856
01:59:41,483 --> 01:59:44,769
I'll let Andre beat you down again,

1857
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:47,227
then pick up Rodney
on the same charges,

1858
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:50,151
and I'll make sure you two
share the same cell.

1859
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,276
The same fuckin' bed.

1860
01:59:53,703 --> 01:59:55,826
Do you understand me clearly?

1861
01:59:56,914 --> 01:59:59,073
Yeah, I understand you clearly.

1862
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:03,252
I just wanted to say thanks, for
gettin' me outta town, that's all.

1863
02:00:08,884 --> 02:00:12,217
It ain't mine, man.
I stopped doin' that.

1864
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:16,923
Get the fuck outta the car.

1865
02:00:34,074 --> 02:00:37,774
Final Call newspaper! Get
your latest edition of Final Call!

1866
02:00:37,827 --> 02:00:42,489
Sir, how are you doing today? Get
your latest edition of Final Call.

1867
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:45,494
Justice In Black And White, sir.

1868
02:00:45,543 --> 02:00:47,203
No, thank you.

1869
02:00:47,253 --> 02:00:50,835
Thank you very much, sir.
Have a pleasant and good day.

1870
02:00:50,881 --> 02:00:55,044
Final Call newspaper! Get your latest
edition of your Final Call newspaper!

1871
02:00:55,093 --> 02:00:56,967
How about you, sir?

1872
02:01:31,085 --> 02:01:32,994
"I'll kill you. "

1873
02:01:33,045 --> 02:01:36,580
I guess somebody read his shirt
the wrong way, huh?

1874
02:01:36,632 --> 02:01:40,250
Whoo!
Right through his fuckin' mouth.

1875
02:01:42,429 --> 02:01:45,216
Another stain on the sidewalk.

1876
02:01:45,265 --> 02:01:49,214
- Hal! Lunch.
- Another dead motherfucker.

1877
02:01:50,311 --> 02:01:53,846
DMF. All right.
Well, Hal, let's go to work.

1878
02:01:53,898 --> 02:01:56,733
- Take it away, Lieutenant.
- OK. Catch you next time.

1879
02:01:56,775 --> 02:01:58,234
Hey, guys.

1880
02:01:58,277 --> 02:02:00,649
They should blow these projects
to Timbuktu.

1881
02:02:00,696 --> 02:02:04,479
Why bother? They kill themselves
anyway, like a self-cleaning oven.

1882
02:02:04,533 --> 02:02:06,192
No fuss, no mess.

1883
02:02:06,243 --> 02:02:09,113
That's how the Nubians do it.
Cycle of shit.

1884
02:02:09,162 --> 02:02:11,653
- Take it easy, guys.
- Take it easy.

1885
02:02:15,626 --> 02:02:17,702
What the fuck happened?

1886
02:02:17,753 --> 02:02:21,336
One snap, that kid
Scientific got shot up.

1887
02:02:21,382 --> 02:02:23,457
What's a Scientific?

1888
02:02:26,219 --> 02:02:30,846
That could be you next.
Mr Scientific.

1889
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:34,757
Nothin' you ain't seen
before, eh, fellas?

1890
02:02:35,144 --> 02:02:37,600
Did you see anything over there?

1891
02:02:37,647 --> 02:02:43,151
Back in the early 1900s,
when trains ran on batteries,

1892
02:02:43,193 --> 02:02:46,230
when people had no electricity
in their houses...

1893
02:02:47,781 --> 02:02:50,319
After World War II, right?

1894
02:02:50,367 --> 02:02:52,240
Tyrone.

1895
02:02:52,285 --> 02:02:55,405
- You know I love you, don't you?
- Yeah.

1896
02:02:59,292 --> 02:03:01,498
- After World War II, right?
- Yeah.

1897
02:03:01,544 --> 02:03:05,043
When people started getting
electricity in their houses,

1898
02:03:05,089 --> 02:03:07,959
they made these - the new ones.

1899
02:03:08,008 --> 02:03:09,668
Wanna hear a whistle?

1900
02:04:49,894 --> 02:04:55,101
Here is my hand
for you to hold

1901
02:04:56,192 --> 02:05:01,399
Here's a part of me
they have not sold

1902
02:05:02,489 --> 02:05:07,780
I've wandered far, I've had my fill

1903
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:14,077
I need you now
do you love me still

1904
02:05:15,168 --> 02:05:19,035
Only you have seen

1905
02:05:21,382 --> 02:05:25,628
The hidden part of me

1906
02:05:27,763 --> 02:05:32,923
Call me foolhardy if you will

1907
02:05:34,144 --> 02:05:40,146
I loved you when
do you love me still

1908
02:05:41,150 --> 02:05:46,571
So many smiles
and lies surround me

1909
02:05:47,656 --> 02:05:52,614
Empty expectations, faceless fears

1910
02:05:53,703 --> 02:05:58,282
Sometimes this life
is a bitter pill

1911
02:05:59,417 --> 02:06:05,087
I love you now
do you love me still

1912
02:06:31,113 --> 02:06:36,273
You have been mine
since time untold

1913
02:06:37,369 --> 02:06:42,611
Our love is immortal don't you know

1914
02:06:43,708 --> 02:06:48,785
Others will come and they will go

1915
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:55,254
But I loved you young
and I'll love you old

1916
02:06:56,345 --> 02:07:01,469
Only you have seen

1917
02:07:02,517 --> 02:07:06,016
The other side of me

1918
02:07:08,898 --> 02:07:13,939
Call me naive, I think you will

1919
02:07:15,029 --> 02:07:21,232
But I loved you then
do you love me still

1920
02:07:22,327 --> 02:07:27,487
Here are the eyes that only see you

1921
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:33,921
Here's a mouth
that only calls your name

1922
02:07:35,006 --> 02:07:39,466
Here is a song they cannot kill

1923
02:07:40,552 --> 02:07:46,222
I love you now
do you love me still
